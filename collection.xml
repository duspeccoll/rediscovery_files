      <Abstract>The Jewish Consumptives' Relief Society was known as the JCRS and was founded in Denver, Colorado in 1904 as a non-sectarian sanatorium to treat tuberculosis (TB) patients, free of charge, in all stages of the disease. The society was one of the leading tuberculosis sanatoria in the country at the turn of the century founded by a group of immigrant Eastern European Jewish men, many of whom were themselves victims of TB. Headed by Dr. Charles Spivak as Secretary (1904-1927) and by Dr. Philip Hillkowitz as President (1904-1948), the sanatorium treated primarily Jewish patients (notably, Solomon Bloomgarden who served as publicity chairman).  In 1954 institution changed its mission to cancer research and became American Medical Center; in 1970s renamed AMC Cancer Research Center and Hospital. Today known as AMC Cancer Research Center.
Records highlight immigration history, medical history (particularly tuberculosis treatment), social and women's history, as well as the growth and development of Colorado's Jewish community. The collection includes correspondence, patient records, legal &amp; financial records, scrapbooks, visitor registers, periodicals, minutes, committee reports, newspaper clippings, sound discs, and photographs.</Abstract>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The Jewish Consumptives' Relief Society (JCRS) was founded in Denver, Colorado in 1904 as a non-sectarian sanatorium to treat tuberculosis patients. At the turn of the century, tuberculosis, or the ''white plague'' as it was commonly known, was the leading cause of death in the United States. Colorado had already acquired its reputation as the ''world's sanatorium,'' and as a result Denver faced a serious social problem when hundreds of severely ill people converged on the young city. The Jewish community erected the first hospital in Denver for tuberculosis victims, the National Jewish Hospital. __Generally only patients with incipient tuberculosis were admitted to National Jewish. It was also difficult for Orthodox patients in the early years to observe the laws of kashruth as well as Jewish rituals and holidays at National Jewish, which had been largely organized and funded by German Reform Jews. Soon the need for another institution was felt by the Jewish community on Denver's west side. In 1904 the Jewish Consumptives' Relief Society was organized by a group of twenty immigrant tradesmen, primarily to aid Jewish tubercular patients in all stages of the disease. They were assisted by Dr. Charles Spivak, Dr. Philip Hillkowitz, Dr. Adolph Zederbaum, Louis Robinson, Abraham Judlovitz, and noted Yiddish poet Solomon Bloomgarden (Yehoash), as well as many others from Denver's Eastern European Jewish community. Housed originally in wooden ''tent'' cottages, the patients were given the benefits of fresh air and wholesome kosher food. Spivak, an ardent socialist, emphasized that the hospital was to be a ''people's institution'' and was proud of the fact that the institution often collected its funds in dollars and quarters. Both the National Jewish Hospital and the JCRS would receive financial support as well as patients from Jewish communities throughout the United States. In 1954 the JCRS changed its mission to cancer research and became the American Medical Center and is now known as the AMC Cancer Research Center.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Abstract>In 1899, the Jewish community erected National Jewish Hospital (NJH), the first sanatorium in Denver, Colorado for tuberculosis victims. With the financial assistance of the International Order of B'nai B'rith, the hospital served Jews and gentiles alike and accepted indigent patients free of charge. The NJH adopted a program that emphasized the benefits of fresh air, good nutrition, and rest. Some of the physicians associated with the hospital included Dr. Saling Simon, Dr. Robert Levy, and Dr. John Elsner. The collection includes correspondence, limited patient records, minutes, financial statements, reports, scrapbooks, and objects from 1899 to 2007.

Non-sectarian sanatorium for treatment of tuberculosis opened in 1899 in Denver, Colo. Patients from all over the U.S. were admitted free of charge. With the assistance of the national B'nai B'rith fraternal organization, the hospital was founded by group of Jewish residents of Denver who were of German descent.  Early founders included Frances Wisebart Jacobs and Rabbi William Friedman of Denver's Congregation Emmanual. Samuel Grabfelder served as president from 1899-1920; Seraphine Pisko was executive secretary from 1911-1938.  In 1997 the organization changed its name to National Jewish Medical and Research Center and focused on lung, allergic and immune diseases.  	Meeting minutes, annual reports, correspondence, limited patient records, financial records, scrapbooks, photographs and sound discs cover tuberculosis treatment, medical history, immigration and acculturation, Colorado's Jewish community and women's history.</Abstract>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __In the late nineteenth century, Denver, Colorado faced a serious social problem when hundreds of people severely ill with tuberculosis converged on the city, attracted by the reputation Denver had already acquired as the ''world's sanatorium.'' Because of the onslaught of consumptives, beds for patients in city and state general hospitals were so scarce that the poor were frequently left to their own devices, often dying in the streets. One of the first people to conceive of a free hospital for the indigent tuberculosis victims in Denver was Frances Wisebart Jacobs. She launched a relentless campaign to arouse public awareness on behalf of the indigent consumptives, seeking the support of businessmen and political leaders to raise funds for a new hospital. Jacobs found an ally in a young, energetic rabbi who had just come to Denver: William Sterne Friedman. Rabbi Friedman enlisted the financial support of some of the trustees of his congregation, Temple Emanuel, insisting that concern for the sick and indigent had always been a vital tenet of Jewish tradition. __National Jewish Hospital for Consumptives (NJH) opened its doors  to Jews and gentiles alike in 1899 as the first sanatorium in Denver for tuberculosis victims. The hospital received financial assistance from the International Order of B'nai B'rith.  This vital support came largely through the efforts of Louis Anfenger, a local Jewish citizen who was also a founder of both Temple Emanuel and the Denver B'nai B'rith. The hospital opened with one building: the Frances Jacobs Hospital Building. Samuel Grabfelder of Louisville, Kentucky, was named president, and Alfred Mueller was named secretary.

As a result of national support, NJH introduced a revolutionary concept to tuberculosis treatment by offering free services to indigent consumptives. The meeting minutes of September 24, 1899, state that ''no pay shall be accepted from any patient and that the hospital should be absolutely free to those suffering from consumption, who are unable for want of means to procure proper attention.'' Only patients with incipient tuberculosis, where treatment could be most efficacious, were to be admitted to NJH, and the length of stay was limited to six months. These conditions reflect the medical opinion of the time and the scarcity of hospital beds for consumptives. It was commonly thought that attempting to treat advanced cases only wasted time and money that could be more profitably directed toward patients who had a good chance of recovery. 

National Jewish Hospital for Consumptives changed its name several times, subsequently being known as National Jewish Hospital and later becoming National Jewish Hospital and Research Center, National Jewish Hospital/National Asthma Center (after merging with National Asthma Center in 1978), National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine, and National Jewish Medical and Research Center. Now known as National Jewish Health, the facility continues to treat patients from throughout the country using cutting-edge medicine and research.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __B'nai B'rith is the oldest and largest of the national Jewish service organizations in the United States. It was founded in New York City in 1843 to unite ''persons of the Jewish faith in the work of promoting their highest interests and those of humanity.'' B'nai B'rith sponsored Americanization classes, trade schools, and relief programs for immigrants, including aiding Jews to leave the East coast of the United States and settle in other parts of the country. B'nai B'rith created the Anti-Defamation League in 1913 to strengthen cooperation among different religions and to protect the status and rights of Jews. B'nai B'rith also founded the Hillel Foundation, which addresses the religious, cultural, and social needs of college students, as well as B'nai B'rith Youth Organization (BBYO). B'nai B'rith is now the oldest and largest Jewish Service organization in the world. The lodges, youth organizations, and women's chapters are located throughout the world. __The B'nai B'rith Denver Lodge No. 171 received its charter from the Independent Order of B'nai B'rith on April 7, 1872. David Kline was the first president. The Denver Lodge developed out of the Denver Hebrew Cemetery Association. Lodge No. 171 has been very active in Colorado and the Lodge was one of the largest in the West. When the Ku Klux Klan rose to power in Colorado politics, the Denver Lodge organized the Anti-Defamation League to battle the Klan. During World War II the Denver Lodge sent packages to soldiers, promoted the sale of War Bonds, and raised funds for the Red Cross. One of the most important projects of Lodge 171 was the vital role it played in establishing the National Jewish Hospital for Consumptives in 1899. In addition, Lodge 171 established the West Side Boys Club to help rehabilitate juvenile delinquents. The Denver Lodge is currently involved in restoring the Jewish cemetery in Leadville.

The B'nai B'rith Youth Organization is comprised of the Aleph Zadeck Aleph (AZA) boys group and the B'nai B'rith Girls (BBG). The Rocky Mountain Region includes the organizations within a seven state area. The organizations have leadership training and social and recreational programs.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Abstract>The Judd Family papers trace the beginnings of the Judd Construction Company under Abraham Judelowitz who arrived in Denver in the 1880s and was instrumental in the building of the first Beth haMedrosh (BMH) Synagogue.

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The National Asthma Center (NAC) had a series of names: the Denver Sheltering Home, National Home for Jewish Children in Denver, Jewish National Home for Asthmatic Children in Denver (JNHAC), and the Children's Asthma Research Institute and Hospital (CARIH). NAC was an independent institution from 1907 until 1978, when it merged with National Jewish Hospital. The NAC campus in west Denver at 19th and Julian Streets was sold in 1981. During the last part of the nineteenth century, Denver, Colorado became a haven for those suffering from tuberculosis, ''the white plague.'' However, no formal medical treatment facilities existed until the opening of National Jewish Hospital (NJH) in 1899. Five years later the Jewish Consumptives' Relief Society (JCRS) began treating patients with advanced cases of tuberculosis.  A Denver housewife, Fannie Lorber, became concerned about the plight of Jewish children left homeless by a parent's hospitalization or orphaned by a parent's death at NJH or JCRS. In 1907, she and her friends Bessie Willens and Sadie Francis organized other local East European immigrant women and founded the Denver Sheltering Home. For the next 51 years, Fannie Lorber presided over the volunteer board of the Home and was the driving force behind fundraising efforts. At first funded entirely by the Denver Jewish Community, the home's expansion eventually led to a system of fundraising Ladies' Auxiliaries throughout the United States. The Home originally sheltered only orphaned or neglected children of tuberculosis victims, but it soon expanded its mission to help combat delinquency among Denver's Jewish children. An arrangement was made with Judge Ben B. Lindsey to send first offenders to the home rather than to a detention center. (Judge Lindsey created the Colorado Juvenile Court system.) The Home also began taking in orphaned and needy children from other cities, and by 1920, approximately 100 children were living on the expanded campus. The aim of the home's founders was to provide a cultured, stimulating, and Jewish environment for the children that was as close to family life as possible, unlike most orphanages of the period. In 1939 the home instituted the long-term residential treatment of children with intractable asthma. In the 1950s medical, psychiatric, and research personnel were added to treat children with asthma and allergies. In 1951, Dr. Allan Hurst became the first full-time medical director and Jack Gershtenson became the administrator, a position he held for nearly thirty years. The home officially became non-sectarian in 1953. Dr. Murray Pershkin, chief consultant to the home from 1940 until 1959, advocated ''parentectomy,'' the removal of the child from his or her home for up to two years. In 1957, the Children's Asthma Research Institute and Hospital was created. At the time it was the only research facility in the county dedicated to asthma and allergic diseases. In 1966, Drs. Kimishige and Taruko Ishizaka, a husband and wife research team at CARIH, discovered immunoglobin E, the physiological basis for asthma. By the 1970s National Jewish Hospital had gone from treating tuberculosis to treating a broader range of respiratory diseases, including asthma. It was decided in 1978 that a merger of the two institutions would be beneficial. Patients remained at the NAC campus until 1981, when it was closed. Fannie Lorber was president from 1907 to 1958, Arthur Lorber was president from 1958 to 1975, and Charles M. Schayer was president from 1975 to 1978.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Abstract>Leopold H. Guldman was born in Harburg, Bavaria in 1853 and immigrated to the United States in 1870.  He was one of Colorado's leading merchants and philanthropists. Guldman came to the Colorado mountains in search of silver, but found it more profitable to open the Golden Eagle clothing stores in Leadville and Cripple Creek. In 1879, Guldman moved to Denver and opened his third and most successful Golden Eagle enterprise, which for many years was Denver's leading popular-price department store. The rapid growth of the Golden Eagle necessitated continual expansion and remodeling. By 1901, its five-story building occupied most of the block at 16th and Lawrence Streets. Guldman's philanthropy contributed to the growth of National Jewish Hospital (NJH), the Jewish Consumptives' Relief Society (JCRS), Beth Israel Hospital, Temple Emanuel, and the Guldman Community Center, which evolved into today's Denver Jewish Community Center. After Guldman's death in 1936, his store endured hard times and was forced to close in 1941.

The collection consists largely of business records including correspondence, ledgers, journals, and financial papers related to the Golden Eagle stores.</Abstract>

      <Abstract>The National Council of Jewish Women, Denver Section (NCJW) was a women's philanthropic organization founded by Carrie Benjamin in October 1893 to serve the Denver, Colorado Jewish community.  Most of the early members were members of Temple Emanuel in Denver and the collection details the contributions of women to social causes in Denver.  Education was an early priority of the Denver Section and classes were held to serve Eastern European Jewish immigrants in the West Colfax area of Denver.  The Council established a settlement house in West Denver for Jewish boys, worked with disabled children and initiated the Children's Traveling Theatre.  During World War II, the Council was involved in the resettlement of Jewish refugees in Denver.  In 1938 the Council opened a thrift shop at 27th Street and Welton Street in the Five Points area of Denver. The records include board of director meeting minutes, lists of officers and board members, correspondence, financial records, newspaper clippings,  newsletters, bulletins, yearbooks, publications, invitations, scrapbooks and oral history audiocassette tapes.</Abstract>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __Susan B. Anthony was determined that women should participate in the World's Fair in Chicago in 1893. Anthony assigned Hannah G. Solomon the task of organizing a group of Jewish women to participate in the Fair. Solomon invited 90 Jewish women to attend the events in Chicago. During discussions at the the Parliament of Religions of the Chicago World's Fair, Solomon convinced her Jewish colleagues of the need for a national organization, and so began the National Council of Jewish Women. Among the women attending the session was Carrie Benjamin, who returned home to Denver, Colorado and organized the Council's Denver section in October 1893. Thirty-nine women met at Temple Emanuel and elected Carrie Benjamin the first president. __Carrie Benjamin and the National Council of Jewish Women (NCJW) worked in the areas of religion, teaching, and philanthropy. Eventually the Council would take a stand on various social issues and reach out to help the community at large. Education was one of the Denver Section's first efforts. They taught classes on West Colfax Avenue to recent Eastern European immigrants, including cooking and sewing classes. Kindergartens (not yet a part of the public school system) were established. By 1908 the Council's adult evening classes offered a variety of subjects, including hammered brass, literature, dramatics, debating and Jewish studies.

In 1910 the Council supervised a summer playground at Cheltenham School on West Colfax Avenue and Julian Street. The Council also established a Citizen's Committee For Public Schools, which worked with other civic organizations to improve Denver's schools and to secure the necessary financial support by issuing bonds. The Council worked closely with Judge Ben Lindsey, founder of Denver's Juvenile Court, and founded a Settlement House in West Denver for Jewish boys. Council members worked regularly at Wallace School (a private school for children with brain injuries) and a group of Council women founded the Children's Traveling Theatre and performed in orphanages and hospitals.

Seraphine Pisko, who served as executive secretary at National Jewish Hospital, was elected to the National Board of the Council and in 1907 was president of the Denver Section. When she saw a sign at a hotel that proclaimed ''No Jews--no consumptives,'' the Council and the Denver B'nai B'rith Lodge successfully lobbied the Colorado Legislature for a bill to prohibit such language in signs and advertisements.

The Council participated in the resettlement of refugees during the Holocaust in Germany. The Council furnished apartments for the refugees, taught them English, and instructed them how to navigate in America. The Council's Committee for Service to the Foreign Born helped members of the Denver community bring European relatives to America. All the efforts were the beginning of a resettlement program that came to prominence when the Denver Jewish Family and Children's Service was established in 1945. The Council worked closely with this agency to develop a resettlement plan known as the ''Denver Plan,'' which became a model for similar programs in other cities. The Council also cooperated with other women's organizations to implement social programs. Through WICS (Women in Community Service), the Council screened and recruited young women for the Job Corps.

The NCJW continues to develop and implement programs to improve the quality of life for people of all ages, races and religious backgrounds, striving to ensure individual rights and freedoms.  The information in the organizational history is from ''Denver Section: Council of Jewish Women'' by Marjorie Hornbein in the Rocky Mountain Jewish Historical Notes Volume 3, Number 2, July 1980.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Abstract>The Fashion Bar began as a hosiery shop established by Jack Levy in 1933 and managed by his sister Hannah Levy. Born in Haigerloch, Germany, both Hannah, Jack with their brother Edward, emigrated to America in the 1920s. Jack started as a traveling salesman and Hannah as a shop girl in Denver, Colorado working for Neusteter's Department Store, before opening their own store which evolved into the Fashion Bar Corporation. Despite the Great Depression, the enterprise flourished and within three years it grew to five clothing stores that were later named Fashion Bar. In 1940, Jack and Hannah Levy bought out their partner and took full control of the business. They brought William Weil on board as manager and later he became president of the company. Records of the Fashion Bar include scrapbooks, photographs, newspaper clippings, drawings, financial records, memorabilia and correspondence.</Abstract>

      <Abstract>In 1976 the Rocky Mountain Jewish Historical Society (RMJHS) began conducting interviews of Denver's long-time Jewish community members in an effort to record oral histories reflecting Jewish history and culture in  Colorado. The interviews were made by the former and current directors of RMJHS as well as its trained volunteers. These recordings of Jewish men and women reveal information about the history of various individuals and families, Jewish organizations, religious groups, medical and social centers, schools, and businesses in Colorado. The oral histories provide insights into the experiences of European-Jewish immigrants and Jewish settlers in Colorado during the 19th and early 20th centuries; the recordings also recount the daily activities that defined Jewish social and professional lives in Colorado.</Abstract>

      <Abstract>Dorothy "Dokes" Berry (nee Kobey) was born in Aspen, Colorado in 1905.  During Berry's childhood Aspen's primary industry was mining and very few Jewish families lived in the town.  Her father and his brothers were businessmen who owned and operated apparel stores in Aspen, including the Kobey Shoe and Clothing Company. After she graduated from Aspen High School, Dorothy Kobey taught at a county school in Cow Creek, Colorado, outside Steamboat Springs.  She moved to Denver, Colorado with her siblings in 1924 to attend the University of Denver after receiving a scholarship to the school.  In 1927 she married Nathan Berry, a salesman who worked at her uncle's downtown Denver business, the Kobey Shoe Store.
The  papers document Jewish family life in Aspen, Colorado during the early 1900s.  The papers contain newspaper and magazine articles, 1 photographic print, family tree charts and a CD-ROM that contains digitized photographs and digitized printed materials, including U.S. census records.
The Dorothy (Dokes) Kobey Berry Papers document the growth of businesses in Colorado mountain towns and Jewish social life and customs in Aspen, Colorado during the early 1900s.  The Kobey families were among the dozen or so Jewish families in the close-knit mining town of Aspen when Dokes Kobey was growing up. This collection documents Jewish family life, with an emphasis on the lives of Jewish women, in Aspen, Colorado in the early 1900s. Dokes Kobey Berry died in Denver on February 24, 2009.</Abstract>

      <Bio_Org_History>Dorothy (Dokes) Kobey Berry was born in Aspen, Colorado in 1905, the fifth of seven children of Leah Sheffel Kobey and Harris Kobey. Leah and Harris Kobey honeymooned in Aspen in 1898 and settled there soon after. Dorothy Kobey’s father and his brothers owned stores in Aspen, including the Kobey Shoe and Clothing Store. Dokes Kobey and her six siblings lived with her uncle, Ben Kobey, after their mother died and Harris Kobey left for the East Coast. The Kobey families were among the dozen or so Jewish families in Aspen when Dokes Kobey was growing up. The mining town of Aspen was a close-knit community and, despite being Jewish, she and her siblings attended functions with non-Jewish children, including activities at the Episcopal and Methodist churches. Dokes Kobey taught at a county school in Cow Creek, outside of Steamboat Springs, Colorado, after her graduation from Aspen High School. She moved to Denver with her siblings in 1924 after receiving a scholarship to the University of Denver. In 1927 she married Nathan Berry, a shoe salesman who worked at her uncle's Kobey Shoe Store in downtown Denver, Colorado. They raised three children, Harold, Joan, and Susan. Dokes Kobey Berry died in Denver on February 24, 2009 at the age of 103.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Abstract>Jessie Shwayder Harsham (named after her grandfather) is a descendant of the Shwayder family, one of the first Jewish families to settle in Colorado. The first member of the extended family, Abraham Rittmaster, arrived in Colorado in the early 1860s and encouraged other family members, including the Rachofskys, Kobeys, and Shwayders to join him in his successful dry goods enterprise in Central City, Colorado. Some family members migrated to other communities in the state, and the Kobeys became prominent in Aspen as the operators of Kobeys Shoe and Clothing Company. In the early 1900s, Jesse Shwayder opened a small luggage factory in Denver with his father Isaac, and brothers Mark, Maurice, Benjamin, and Solomon. Together they eventually turned it into one of the largest luggage producers in America, the Samsonite Company.</Abstract>

      <Abstract>Louis Anfenger was typical of the young Jewish men who migrated to the Colorado Territory in the state's formative years. Born in Bavaria, Anfenger came to the United States in the 1850s and moved to Denver in 1870 to seek his fortune. He became a highly successful businessman in the area of real estate as well as a member of the Denver Chamber of Commerce and was later elected to the state legislature in the 1880s. He was a founder of Congregation Emanuel, Denver B'nai B'rith, and National Jewish Hospital. He married Louise Schlesinger Anfenger, and the couple became the parents of eight children, who later also became leaders in the Denver community. His eldest son Milton became a lawyer and a Colorado State Senator in 1904, and his daughter Flora married prominent Denver attorney Philip Hornbein. 

The collection includes Louis Anfenger's diary and clothing, needlework, household accessories, furniture, and memorabilia belonging to various members of the extended Anfenger family.</Abstract>

      <Bio_Org_History>Babi Yar Park in Denver, Colorado was dedicated on October 2, 1983 to memorialize the September 1941 massacre of the Jews that remained in the Ukrainian city of Kiev, at a ravine called Babi Yar.  The leaders of the Colorado Committee of Concern for Soviet Jewry, Rabbi Raymond Zwerin and Lillian Hoffman, asked Denver Mayor McNichols if he would name a street Babi Yar. McNichols suggested that an undeveloped Denver-owned 27-acre site could be developed and named Babi Yar Park. Helen Ginsburg, a Denver sculptor, agreed to chair a committee for the purpose of developing the park site. In April of 1971, a committee was organized to raise funds to develop the park and create a sculpture. The committee hired Lawrence Halprin Associates, an internationally known landscape architecture firm who had designed Denver’s Skyline Park, to design the park. The Babi Yar Park Foundation was formed under the leadership of Helen Ginsburg. In 1985, leading Holocaust scholar Eli Wiesel attended a service at the park and in a second event, a survivor of the massacre visited the park and noted how similar the park was to the Babi Yar ravine.  In 2005, Larry Mizel agreed to allow the Mizel Museum to take over stewardship and the Foundation was dissolved and merged into the Mizel Museum’s program. Alan Golin Gass, a Denver architect, and other Foundation members continued to be active in the Babi Yar planning process. The artist-architect team of Kryzsztof Wodiczko and Julian Bonder was hired to create a Memorial to Victims of World Terrorism at Babi Yar Park.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Abstract>Bernard Zion Lande, the grandson of early Denver Jewish pioneer Zion Wolf Karsh, was born in Denver, Colorado, on July 11, 1927. Lande grew up on Denver's west side and attended the Hebrew Educational Alliance. While still in his teens, he helped to found the Jewish Youth Council, and in 1947 he attended the Brandeis Camp in California, where he gained his first exposure to the philosophies of the Jewish Reconstructionist movement. Lande received a master's degree in social psychology from the University of Denver in 1950, and he served in the army for two years as a research psychologist in Beckly, West Virginia. He was instrumental in the establishment, organization, and evaluation of havurot--groups of people who gather together to read, study, and worship at each other's homes--and these fellowships ultimately evolved into the Colorado Jewish Reconstructionist Federation. Lande died at the age of 51 on July 24, 1978. The collection consists of papers belonging to Lande, including personal papers about psychology, papers related to his travels, papers about Shalom Bardin Institute, papers about the Brandeis Camp Institute, notes, journals, correspondence, a framed certificate, and publications.</Abstract>

      <Bio_Org_History>Bernard Zion Lande, the grandson of early Denver Jewish pioneer Zion Wolf Karsh, was born in Denver, Colorado, on July 11, 1927. Lande grew up on Denver's west side and attended the Hebrew Educational Alliance, an orthodox synagogue. While still in his teens, he helped to found the Jewish Youth Council and became an active participant in its programs. In 1947, Lande attended the Brandeis Camp in California, where he gained his first exposure to the philosophies of the Jewish Reconstructionist movement. After a brief trip to Israel in 1950, where he met his future wife, Lande returned to Brandeis Camp in 1951 to serve as boys' counselor. He married Betty Freeman in Toronto, Canada, in 1952 and returned to Denver shortly thereafter, where he started a small upholstered-furniture business called the Lande Manufacturing Company. 

Bernard Lande had a deep interest in social psychology, especially in the insights it shed upon Jewish identity. He received a master's degree in social psychology from the University of Denver in 1950 and was pursuing post-graduate work in group dynamics when he was drafted into the army in 1953. He served in the army for two years as a research psychologist in Beckly, West Virginia. Lande was instrumental in the establishment, organization, and evaluation of havurot--groups of people who gather together to read, study, and worship at each other's homes--and these fellowships ultimately evolved into the Colorado Jewish Reconstructionist Federation. Lande also played a major role in the founding of Denver's Jewish Community Center. He died at the age of 51 on July 24, 1978.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Most of Greeley's early Jews were Orthodox and services were held in private homes until 1925 when Beth Israel Congregation was formed in Greeley, Colorado and houses were rented for services. In 1952 Beth Israel had it's first synagogue when it purchased a former church in 1952 and incorporated in June 1953. The first trustees in 1953 were Louis Dinner, Sam Gold, and Abe Winnograd. In the 1970s the congregation helped resettle Russian Jews in Greeley and formed a local chapter of the Colorado Committee of Concern for Soviet Jewry. Among the leaders of the Congregation were members of the Winograd family. Abe Winograd was born in Poland in 1885 and came to the United States in 1909. He settled in Greeley in 1916. His daughter Eleanor Winograd Judd and her husband Morris also helped to lead the Congregation. In 1974, a pre-fabricated synagogue building was erected at 1625 Reservoir Road.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __Congregation Micah, the second Jewish Reform congregation in Denver, was started by members of Denver's Temple Emanuel who felt that their congregation had strayed from the principles taught by its former leader, Rabbi William Friedman. Congregation Micah originated with the Denver School for Reform Judaism, which opened in September 1955 and offered classes to kindergarteners through ninth graders at the Barnes School of Commerce. A number of individuals involved in the school's formation started a Reform Judaism congregation, which became incorporated in September 1956 as the Denver Congregation for Reform Judaism and changed its name to Congregation Micah, after the Biblical prophet Micah, in 1957. The congregation moved into the first temple of its own, located at 195 South Monaco Parkway in Denver, in 1962. Congregation Micah sold its building to Mount Gilead Baptist Church in 1976, but the two congregations occupied the structure jointly until 1979, when Congregation Micah shared space with Park Hill Congregational Church. Congregation Micah is still active, currently meeting at 2600 Leyden in Denver.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Abstract>Congregation Shearith Israel (Remnant of Israel), or the Tenth Street Shul as it was also known,  was founded in 1899 as a Jewish orthodox synagogue. The young congregation bought a small stone church in Denver at the Tenth Street site in 1903 and remodeled the building to suit its needs as a synagogue. The last of the operating synagogues in the "Old Colfax" area of Denver, Shearith Israel closed its doors in 1958, having been largely used by Jewish businessmen working in the downtown area seeking a convenient synagogue for daily prayer services. The building, which was named an Historic Landmark in 1976, has been converted to an art gallery on the Auraria Campus. The collection includes documents, objects, and textiles, most notably an early Torah cover.</Abstract>

      <Arrang_Organiz>The collection is arranged into three series: 1. Clothing, circa 1885-1924. 2.  Biographical Materials, 1882-1994. 3. Photographs,  circa 1885-1994.</Arrang_Organiz>
      <Bio_Org_History>Frances Wisebart Jacobs earned the nickname ''Mother of Charities'' because of her many efforts to assist the poor, the homeless, and  the disenfranchised. She was born March 29, 1843, in Harrodsburg, Kentucky. Her family moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, when she was a child, and there she was educated and became a teacher. She married Abraham Jacobs in 1863, and they moved to Colorado one year later, first residing in Central City and then settling in Denver. Jacobs joined the Hebrew Ladies' Benevolent Society and became its president, founded the nonsectarian Denver Ladies' Relief Society and served as its first vice president, worked with community leaders of varying religious backgrounds to found the Charity Organization Society in 1887, and was involved in the National Conference of Charities and Correction. 

Jacobs was one of the first people to conceive of a free hospital for indigent tuberculosis victims in Denver.  She started a  campaign to increase public awareness on behalf of  indigent consumptives, seeking the support of businessmen and political leaders  in raising funds for a new hospital.  The fruit of her efforts was the construction of Jewish Hospital in 1892. Jacobs died of peritonitis this same year. Her memory was honored in 1900, when she became the only woman of 16 Colorado pioneers whose stained glass portraits were placed in the rotunda of Denver's capitol building.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Abstract>Future Israeli prime minister Golda Meir (Golda Mabovitch Meyerson) resided in Denver from 1913 to 1914 as a high school student. After an argument with her parents, she ran away from Milwaukee to join her sister Shayna Mabovitch Korngold and her husband Sam in Denver. Shayna was one of the many east European Jews who flocked to Colorado to "chase the cure" for tuberculosis. Shana was a patient at both the National Jewish Hospital (NJH) and later at the Jewish Consumptives' Relief Society (JCRS). After recovering her health, she married San Korngold and settled in a small duplex in the West Colfax Jewish immigrant neighborhood. While in Denver, Golda lived with Shana and Sam, attended North High School, met her future husband, and developed her social and political views and her lifelong committment to democratic socialism.

The collection includes clippings and documents related to Golda Meir and Shana Korngold, including a copy of Golda's report card and Shana's patient application record for the JCRS.</Abstract>

The members were largely drawn from middle class and practiced a more traditional form of Judaism. They supported medical services and educational activities in Palestine. Jewish women organized a chapter in Denver in 1915. By 1918 the membership reached two hundred, and by 1948 it had grown to eighteen hundred. Belle Kauvar, wife of Vilna-born Rabbi Charles Kauvar, was an early leader in the Denver group.

      <Abstract>The Hebrew Educational Alliance was founded in 1932 and became the largest congregation on Denver's west side. The Hebrew Educational Alliance was created as a result of the ''alliance'' between the Beth David Hebrew School Sisterhood and Brotherhood, and the Denver Hebrew Institute. The combined synagogue and Hebrew School was organized along Orthodox lines. On October 25, 1932, Rabbi Manuel Laderman arrived in Denver to serve as the first Rabbi of the Hebrew Educational Alliance. In 1994, the Alliance affiliated with the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism. The HEA collection shows the history of a synagogue and school that continues to serve Jewish families in Denver.</Abstract>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __Between 1899 and 1903 a large wave of Romanian Jews fled to New York. The “Rumanian Committee” was formed in New York to find jobs and move the Romanian immigrants to other parts of the United States. The Committee evolved into the Industrial Removal Office (IRO) and began aiding any unemployed Jewish immigrants. In 1901 the Denver lodge of the Independent Order of B’nai B’rith established a “Rumanian Refugee Committee,” later the IRO Committee. Goals of the IRO were to aid Eastern European Jews become part of American society and resolve some of the burdens on relief societies in the overcrowded eastern cities. Between 1900 and 1917, of the 80,000 immigrants dispersed throughout the country by the IRO, 2791 immigrants were settled in Colorado. The Jewish Relief Society of Denver was very involved in the early years of resettlement. In 1906 Congress passed the Galveston Plan, making Galveston, Texas another entry station into the United States in an effort to discourage new Jewish immigrants from settling in New York and other eastern cities. Many of the Galveston immigrants were sent to Denver, provided they could be supported by families and did not have tuberculosis. The Jewish community of Denver before the 1880s, was primarily German or native-born, but by 1910 the Eastern European Jews would greatly outnumber the Americanized Jews of German descent. Lesser Levy was chairman of the B’nai B’rith Removal Committee from 1901 to 1907 and Milton Schayer was Chairman from 1907 to 1914 when the IRO Committee was disbanded.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Irene Miller (Mrs. Azriel) Stein was born in Denver, Colo. in 1894 and died in Aurora, Colorado in 2000 at the age of 106. She was the daughter of Anna and Robert Lazar Miller, both pioneers of Denver's Jewish community. Robert Lazar Miller was born in Vilna, Lithuania, in about 1845. He married Anna Weinstein in Lithuania and came to America in the late 1870s, following his brother Joe. In about 1878, Robert Lazar Miller moved to Denver and opened a kosher butcher shop at 1128 Larimer street. He then brought his wife, eldest children, and his parents to Denver. His mother Bessie died after World War I at the age of 102. Robert Lazar Miller bought and sold cattle and later became chief buyer for K and B Packing Company (headed by Louis Sigman) when he was 71. He continued in that job and rode his horse daily at the Union Stockyards until his death at 96 in July of 1940. 

Irene Stein was a professional artist well into her 90s. She worked in many different media and styles, from art-deco in the 1920s and 1930s to modern, abstract sculptures and computer generated art in the 1970s and 1980s. She attended the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1921 she married Azriel Stein, born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1896 and moved to Denver with his family at the age of 14. Azriel ''Azie'' Stein, and his brother-in-law Joe Peterman (Sophie Miller's husband), founded, owned, and operated Pencol Drug Store on the corner of Pennsylvania Street and Colfax Avenue in Denver. Irene and Azriel's son Stanley was born in 1928. Azriel Stein died in 1976.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Isidor D. Bronfin was born September 13, 1886, in Lantzkriene, Podolsk, Russia, to Leah and David Bronfin. In 1902 he migrated to the United States and attended school in New York City. Bronfin received a bachelor of arts degree at the University of North Carolina and earned a medical degree from the University of the State of New York in 1911--the same year that he became a U.S. citizen. He married Elizabeth Rothbardt in 1915, and they had two sons, Leon and Gerald. 

Bronfin was a noted authority on tuberculosis treatment and authored several publications on this topic. From 1918 to 1920 he was medical director and superintendent of Beth Israel Hospital of Boston. From 1921 to 1927 he served as medical director and superintendent of the Jewish Consumptives' Relief Society in Denver, Colorado. He was medical director and superintendent of National Jewish Hospital (Denver) from 1927 until his death. Bronfin's other involvement in the medical community included his roles as assistant professor of medicine at the University of Colorado, as director of the Central Jewish Aid Society, and as a member or leader of several other medical organizations in Colorado and at the national level. Bronfin died of tuberculosis on July 30, 1934. His son Leon Bronfin died, at the age of 17, less than four months after Isidor Bronfin died.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>The Jewish Community Center of Denver opened in 1922 at the Louise Guldman Center, a modest building on Denver's west side, moving to expanded headquarters at 16th and Irving Streets shortly thereafter. With the initiation of day camping and programs for young adults and seniors, the JCC outgrew this second home and began to rent facilities from other organizations, including the Bânai Bârith Lodge at East Colfax and Williams Street. In 1962, a new Jewish Community Center opened on 10 acres of land at East Alameda and Dahlia Streets, the Center's current site. In 1995, after extensive renovation, the Center was dedicated as the Robert E. Loup Jewish Community Center in honor of Mr. Loup's leadership and service.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The Jewish Family and Children’s Service of Colorado (JFCS) was created in a response to international, national, and local needs of refugees.  The JFCS emerged from two organizations, the National Council of Jewish Women, Denver Section (NCJW), founded in 1893 and the Central Jewish Aid Society of Denver, Colorado, organized in 1915 and incorporated in 1923. Ray David was the first superintendent of the Jewish Aid Society. In 1937, Tillye Levy became a member of the Service to Foreign Born Committee of the NCJW and immediately began organizing resources for Jews who fled the early stages of the Holocaust. The services supplied facilitated the adjustment of the refugees. At Tillye Levy’s request, Isadore Hilb became the first chair of the new Denver Coordinating Committee for Refugees. A. B. Hirshfield was the chair of the job placement committee, Dave Harlem was in charge of creating affidavits, and Surriee Feder Miller was responsible for integrating newcomers into the Denver community. In 1947, the Jewish Family and Children’s Service was created when the boards of the Central Jewish Aid Society and the NCJW committees merged. Sydney Grossman became the newly formed agency’s first president, and Dr. Alfred Neumann, a social worker, became the full-time director. The name was changed to the Jewish Family and Children's Service of Denver in 1954 and became the Jewish Family and Children's Service of Colorado in 1972. The JFCS continued to give relief to the needy and assist refugees in resettling, but also expanded into the field of family and child welfare. The JFCS created the “Denver Plan,” procedures for integrating new residents into the community, which was copied by cities across the United States. The agency hired trained staff to provide service in three areas: family, child, and vocational guidance; service to established residents; and immigrant aid. The agency also handled German reparation money through the Utility Workshop, headed by Mary (Mrs. Sidney) Jacobs. The Utility Workshop produced jobs and services for individuals suffering from emotional or physical handicaps. The services provided by the JFCS continue on through its successor, the Jewish Family Service of Colorado.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Abstract>Dr. John Elsner was born in Vienna on May 4, 1844 and migrated to America as a young man. Elsner graduated from the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary. In 1866, he graduated from the Bellevue Hospital Medical College in New York. After becoming interested in the American West, he led a wagon train into Colorado in 1866 and was Denver's first Jewish physician. He was appointed Denver County physician in 1870 and was the prime mover in the establishment of Denver's first general hospital (now Denver Health). In addition to a busy private practice, he also traveled the region as a mohel to perform the traditional Jewish rite of circumcision. Highly active in the Jewish and general community, served as the president of Denver's B'nai B'rith chapter in 1874.  Elsner was an incorporator of National Jewish Hospital for Consumptives in 1890 and served on the hospital's first medical advisory board.

The collection includes copies of his early memoirs, medical and early circumcision records, and other related documents.</Abstract>

      <Bio_Org_History>Born in Russia in 1878, Lipa Feingold was a jeweler by profession, but his avocation was music. In 1903 Feingold married Bessis Braude in Russia and they both immgrated to the United States about 1905. In 1907, while living in New York City, Bessie was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and her physician recommended the family move to Denver to seek a cure. The family arrived in Denver in 1907 and built a small house at Colfax Avenue and Chase Street, located in the city's west side East European Jewish community. Feingold worked as a jeweler in Denver and in his spare time composed muscial compositions and lyrics in both Yiddish and English. In 1925,  Feingold left Denver to pursue his musical ambitions in New York City on Tin Pan Alley, the center of the American popular music scene. Feingold achieved modest success in the music field and he retained a loyal following among American Jewish immigrants. Feingold contracted tuberculosis soon after leaving Denver and was a patient at the Motefiore Sanatorium in New York City for a time. He died on October 7, 1945 in New York City.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Abstract>The founders of the Ostrover Synagogue in Denver, Colorado hailed from Ostrov, Poland. The congregation was formally organized in 1908 as Congregation Ostrover Beth Jacob. Their first building was erected on Clay Street, but the synaogogue was later relocated to Federal Blvd. when the congregants outgrew their building and the city built a viaduct over the first building. The congregation remained at Federal Boulevard until 1949, when they relocated to a modest brick building on the northwest corner of 14th Ave. and Lowell Blvd. The  congregation was one of the largest of over a dozen synagogues in the West Colfax east European immigrant Jewish neighborhood. When the congregation disbanded, it donated its remaining funds to Beth Israel Hospital and Home, where the chapel there was named Ostrover Beth Jacob in gratitude.</Abstract>

      <Bio_Org_History>Seraphine Eppstein Pisko (1861-1942) was known for her charitable work in Denver, Colorado, during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and she was most likely the first Jewish woman in America to head a national Jewish organization. She was born to Max and Bertha Eppstein on January 1, 1861, in St. Joseph, Missouri, and moved to Denver in 1875. She married Edward Pisko in 1878 but was widowed a few years later and never remarried. Seraphine Pisko served as president of the Hebrew Ladies' Benevolent Society and of the Denver Chapter of the National Council of Jewish Women (NCJW). She later became vice president of the NCJW board at the national level. She began working at National Jewish Hospital for Consumptives (NJH) as a field secretary, a fund raiser, in 1900 and in 1911 she became the executive-secretary of National Jewish Hospital and served in that position until 1938 when she retired. Pisko was actively involved in both Jewish and secular social organizations, gaining national renown for her organizational strengths as well as her social efforts. She died in Denver in 1942.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>The Shwayder family of Denver, Colorado is best known for the luggage company Samsonite Corporation, which was founded and operated by the family over the course of the 20th century. The Denver Shwayders can be traced to Abraham Kobesky and Miriam Rachofsky of Poland, who married and later migrated to Manchester, England (where the name ''Kobesky'' was shortened to ''Kobey''). Their daughter Rachel Kobey married Isaac Shwayder, who had also migrated to Manchester from Eastern Europe. Rachel and Isaac Shwayder had 11 children: Solomon, Dora, Jesse, Raschelle, Mark, Gertrude, Florence, Maurice, Hannah, Benjamin, and Liebe. Isaac Shwayder first came to Central City, Colorado, in 1879 to find work, and after two years the rest of his family joined him. The Shwayders later moved to Nevadaville (Black Hawk), Colorado, and in 1888 they settled in Denver, where Isaac Shwayder owned a grocery store and later started a second-hand furniture business. The Shwayder children attended Franklin School and West High School in Denver, and Solomon Shwayder, the oldest brother, attended the University of Denver. In 1910 Jesse Shwayder opened a small luggage factory in Denver with his father, Isaac, and brothers, Mark, Maurice, Benjamin, and Solomon. The business became incorporated as the Shwayder Trunk Manufacturing Company in 1912, and it eventually changed its name to Samsonite Corporation. Isaac Shwayder died of a stroke in 1916. Most of the Shwayder siblings held executive positions in the family business. In 1961 Jesse Shwayder’s son, King Shwayder, became president of the Samsonite Corporation. __ __Samsonite Corporation, the world-famous maker of luggage, started in Denver, Colorado, in 1910, when Jesse Shwayder opened a small luggage factory in Denver with his father, Isaac Shwayder, and brothers, Mark, Maurice, Benjamin, and Solomon Shwayder. The operation became incorporated as the Shwayder Trunk Manufacturing Company in 1912 and counted many members of the Shwayder family among its employees. All of the Shwayder brothers held executive positions in the company in the 1920s: Jesse was the company's president, Mark Shwayder was in charge of sales, Maurice and Ben Shwayder were in charge of manufacturing, and Solomon Shwayder served as the company’s lawyer. Samson was the first trade name for the company’s luggage, and this was later changed to Samsonite. Shwayder Trunk Manufacturing Company started to diversify its product offerings in the 1930s by manufacturing folding furniture, and the company changed its name to Shwayder Brothers, Inc. in 1931. As sales increased throughout the 20th century, the company moved into gradually larger facilities in Denver, and at various stages in the business’ history, it opened additional plants in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Arizona, Mexico, and Japan.  In 1961 Jesse Shwayder’s son, King D. Shwayder, became president of the company, and in 1965 the Shwayder Brothers, Inc., changed its name to Samsonite Corporation.

The Denver Shwayders can be traced to Abraham Kobesky and Miriam Rachofsky of Poland, who married and later migrated to Manchester, England (where the name ''Kobesky'' was shortened to ''Kobey''). Their daughter Rachel Kobey married Isaac Shwayder, who had also migrated to Manchester from Eastern Europe. Rachel and Isaac Shwayder had 11 children: Solomon, Dora, Jesse, Raschelle, Mark, Gertrude, Florence, Maurice, Hannah, Benjamin, and Liebe. Isaac Shwayder first came to Central City, Colorado, in 1879 to find work, and after two years the rest of his family joined him. The Shwayders later moved to Nevadaville (Black Hawk), Colorado, and in 1888 they settled in Denver, where Isaac Shwayder owned a grocery store and later started a second-hand furniture business. The Shwayder children attended Franklin School and West High School in Denver, and Solomon Shwayder, the oldest brother, attended the University of Denver. In 1910 Jesse Shwayder opened a small luggage factory in Denver with his father, Isaac, and brothers, Mark, Maurice, Benjamin, and Solomon. The business became incorporated as the Shwayder Trunk Manufacturing Company in 1912, and it eventually changed its name to Samsonite Corporation. Isaac Shwayder died of a stroke in 1916. Most of the Shwayder siblings held executive positions in the family business. In 1961 Jesse Shwayder’s son, King Shwayder, became president of the Samsonite Corporation.</Bio_Org_History_Biograph._History>
      <Bio_Org_History_Organiz._History>Samsonite Corporation, the world-famous maker of luggage, started in Denver, Colorado, in 1910, when Jesse Shwayder opened a small luggage factory in Denver with his father, Isaac Shwayder, and brothers, Mark, Maurice, Benjamin, and Solomon Shwayder. The operation became incorporated as the Shwayder Trunk Manufacturing Company in 1912 and counted many members of the Shwayder family among its employees. All of the Shwayder brothers held executive positions in the company in the 1920s: Jesse was the company's president, Mark Shwayder was in charge of sales, Maurice and Ben Shwayder were in charge of manufacturing, and Solomon Shwayder served as the company’s lawyer. Samson was the first trade name for the company’s luggage, and this was later changed to Samsonite. Shwayder Trunk Manufacturing Company started to diversify its product offerings in the 1930s by manufacturing folding furniture, and the company changed its name to Shwayder Brothers, Inc. in 1931. As sales increased throughout the 20th century, the company moved into gradually larger facilities in Denver, and at various stages in the business’ history, it opened additional plants in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Arizona, Mexico, and Japan.  In 1961 Jesse Shwayder’s son, King D. Shwayder, became president of the company, and in 1965 the Shwayder Brothers, Inc., changed its name to Samsonite Corporation. The corporation continues to operate in the 21st century.</Bio_Org_History_Organiz._History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Charles David Spivak was born in Russia in 1861 and died in Denver in 1927. Spivak became a revolutionary Socialist in his youth and had to flee Russia to avoid being arrested by the Russian secret police. He arrived in New York City in 1882 and took various jobs until he learned English. He worked as a day laborer in New York, a factory worker in Maine, and as typesetter on the ''Jewish Messenger.'' In 1890 he graduated from Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia with honors, and by 1895 he was Chief of Staff of the Philadelphia Polyclinics in Gastro-Internal diseases. In 1893 Charles Spivak married Jennie Charsky and they had three children: David, Deena, and Ruth. Jennie Charsky was born in Russia in 1871 and briefly studied law at Cornell before graduating from the University of Denver. 

Because of Jennie's poor health, which was probably caused by incipient tuberculosis, the Spivaks moved to Denver in 1896. Dr. Spivak served as a Professor at the University of Denver from 1896 through 1901. Jennie was a Russian language instructor at the University from 1903 until 1913. Charles Spivak was a co-founder of the Jewish Consumptives' Relief Society (JCRS) and was the executive secretary from 1904 until 1927. Jennie Spivak was listed as one of the three formal incorporaters of the JCRS. Charles Spivak was involved in every aspect of the JCRS and was affectionately known as ''Papa Spivak.'' In addition to writing articles for the JCRS publication, ''The Sanatorium,'' he co-authored a well known Yiddish dictionary with Yiddish poet, Yehoash.  In 1898 Spivak became founding editor and publisher of the journal Medical Libraries, and wrote for the ''Denver Jewish News'' from 1915 to 1918. Charles and Jennie Spivak's son Hayem David Spivak was born November 19, 1893 in Philadelphia and died in Denver November 23, 1932. He studied at the University of Denver, the Art Institute of Chicago, Illinois and the Art Students League, New York. He was one of three co-founders of the Denver Artists Guild, now the Colorado Artists Guild.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Abstract>Congregation Emanuel, the oldest synagogue in Colorado, was founded in Denver by a group of mostly German Jewish immigrants. At a meeting in 1874, members of the congregation decided to draft a constitution and incorporate the congregation as an institution of Reform Judaism. Rabbi Samuel Weil became the congregation's first rabbi in 1876; he served the congregation for only a year and was followed by a number of rabbis whose terms were short-lived. Rabbi William S. Friedman became the spiritual leader of Temple Emanuel in 1889 and led the congregation for nearly 50 years. The Sisterhood of Temple Emanuel originated as the Ladies' Sewing Society, in 1915 changed its name to the Ladies' Auxiliary, and became the Sisterhood of Temple Emanuel in 1915. Congregation Emanuel is still active today and its current synagogue is located at 51 Grape Street. The collection consists of Congregation Emanuel records, the Sisterhood and Brotherhood records, and the Emanuel cemetery records.</Abstract>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __Congregation Emanuel, the oldest synagogue in Colorado, was founded in Denver by a group of mostly German Jewish immigrants. A. H. Fleischer started leading services for Congregation Emanuel in 1872. At a meeting in 1874, members of the congregation, including Fleischer, Leon Alexander, Emanuel Anfenger, Louis Anfenger, Jacob S. Appel, Emanuel Block, Joseph Block, Samuel Cole, M. I. Garson, Benjamin Hamburger, Michael Hattenbach, Emanuel Heitler, Abraham Jacobs, Montagu Leverson, Julius Londoner, Samuel Rose, N. Rosenthal, Charles M. Schayer, M. R. Sperborg, Phil Trounstine, Edward Whitehead, and David Kline decided to draft a constitution and incorporate the congregation as an institution of Reform Judaism. Louis Anfenger was the first president of Congregation Emanuel, David Kline its first vice president, Jacob S. Appel its first secretary, and Charles M. Schayer its first treasurer. 

Congregation Emanuel's first temple was built at 19th and Curtis streets in 1875. The congregation dedicated this temple and created a religious school in 1876. Rabbi Samuel Weil became the congregation's first rabbi that same year; he served the congregation for only a year and was followed by a number of rabbis whose terms were short-lived. In 1881, the congregation's board of trustees decided to move into a larger building to accommodate a growing membership. A second temple was built at 24th and Curtis streets and was dedicated in 1882.  Rabbi William S. Friedman became the spiritual leader of Congregation Emanuel in 1889, and he led Temple Emanuel for nearly 50 years. Congregation Emanuel moved into its third building, at 16th and Pearl streets, in 1899 and remained there until 1957, when it relocated to its present location at 51 Grape Street. __The Sisterhood of Temple Emanuel originated as the Ladies' Sewing Society, in 1915 changed its name to the Ladies' Auxiliary, and became the Sisterhood of Temple Emanuel in 1915. The first president was Mrs. William Weil. The Sisterhood maintained a community religious school in West Denver. The sewing circle made clothing for the patients at the National Jewish Hospital, Jewish Consumptives' Relief Society, and for the children at the National Sheltering Home. During World War II, the Sisterhood organized the Sisterhood Canteen and the Sisterhood continues to organize many programs and activities.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Scope-Content>The collection contains the cookbook itself, administrative records associated with the book's planning and creation, newspaper and magazine clippings, and documents used to publicize and market the book. The majority of records are from the 1990s, although some are from the first decade of the 21st century. Most records were created by Friends of Shalom Park, the group of Denver, Colorado, volunteers and supporters who planned and coordinated the book--with the proceeds benefiting Shalom Park, a Jewish nursing home and a residential health and social services facility for seniors. The majority of article clippings come from various Colorado newspapers, but a few articles are from other parts of the United States or from national magazines. The records document the process involved in creating the cookbook, and they provide information about Jewish cooking and the Jewish community in Colorado.</Scope-Content>

      <Bio_Org_History>Jacob Gorden was a schocket (Jewish ritual slaughter), a mohel (one who performs the ritual circumcision), and a Talmudic scholar in Denver, Colorado. He and his wife Charlotte Gorden were leaders of the Orthodox Jewish community on Denver's west side and helped the Hebrew Educational Alliance. Velvel Heller, Jacob Gorden's uncle, had established himself as a schocket in Denver. Velvel Heller wrote his nephew of the opportunities in Denver and Jacob decided that he emigrate from Kolk, Russia to Denver in 1914. Jacob Gorden became a schocket and by 1917 had saved enough money to bring his wife Charlotte Gorden and his daughter Bess Gorden to Denver. In the next few years two more daughters and a son were born to the Gordens. The Gordens then moved to 1490 Julian Street. In 1935 Jacob Gorden also began work as a mohel. In 1944 Jacob Gorden was asked by Dr. Maurice Shapiro of Albuquerque, New Mexico to perform ritual circumcisions in New Mexico. In Albuquerque a blindfold was placed over Jacob Gorden's eyes for the ride to the final destination. Jacob Gorden only told his wife where he had been after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan. He could then tell his wife that he had been in Las Animas, New Mexico. In 1926, Charlotte Gorden, Mrs. Chernyk and Mrs. S. Friedman began the Beth David Sisterhood for the purpose of building a school for Jewish children. The Beth David Brotherhood was formed to help with fundraising and the two groups founded the Beth Jacob Hebrew School at the Gorden home in 1929. The Denver Hebrew Institute was willing to merge with the new group and the organization became the Hebrew Education Alliance, a synagogue with a focus on Jewish Education. Jacob Gorden became the Gabbai (the person in charge of selecting the Torah readings during the Sabbath service) for the new sysnagogue and served in that position for over forty years. Jacob Gorden died at the age of eighty-nine.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Sam Berman was born August 9, 1911, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Joseph and Ida Berman. Joseph Berman had tuberculosis, and the family moved to Denver, Colorado, so that he could receive therapy at the Jewish Consumptives’ Relief Society. Joseph Berman passed away when his son was two years old, and Sam Berman was placed in the Denver Sheltering Home shortly thereafter. Ida Berman remarried but died in childbirth when Sam Berman was seven.  
 
Sam Berman spent the longest amount of time at the Denver Sheltering Home of any of its residents. He attended Cheltenham School, Lake Junior High, and North High School. The Home, in consideration of Berman’s long service there, sponsored his education at the University of Denver (DU) as an undergraduate and later as a law student. He was admitted to the Bar in 1933, and his law practice focused on real estate (specifically closings, title examination, and landlord-tenant issues) and probate work. Berman founded Attorneys Title Guarantee Company. Within the Denver community he engaged in professional activities and joined and participated in observant and leadership roles at Beth Joseph Congregation (he was confirmed at Beth haMedrosh Hagodol Congregation).
 
Berman married Blanche Grosinger on December 19, 1948.  They had five children: John, Stephen, Martha, Lawrence, and Daniel. Sam Berman was the sole proprietor of his law practice throughout his entire career, frequently sharing office space with realty companies. He practiced law until 1998. Blanche Berman died on January 11, 2002, and Sam Berman died three months later on April 10, 2002. __Sam Berman was born August 9, 1911, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as the youngest of three children of Joseph and Ida Berman. Joseph Berman had tuberculosis, and the family moved to Denver, Colorado, so that he could receive therapy at the Jewish Consumptives’ Relief Society.  Joseph Berman passed away when Sam Berman was two years old. Shortly thereafter, Sam Berman was placed in the Denver Sheltering Home. Ida Berman remarried but died in childbirth when Sam Berman was seven.  
 
Sam Berman spent the longest amount of time at the Denver Sheltering Home of any of its residents. The Cohens, the Home’s directors, were his on-site family, and Reverend and Mrs. Jacob Gordon were his off-site family. The Home's younger residents remarked that Sam Berman ''raised them,''  and they remained friendly with Berman throughout their lives. 
While Berman was a resident at the Home, he attended Cheltenham School, Lake Junior High, and North High School. The Home, in consideration of Berman’s long service there, sponsored his education at the University of Denver (DU) as an undergraduate and later as a law student. Sam Berman continued to live at the Home while he was a DU student. At DU he took up playing the tuba so he could play in the pep band and attend DU football games for free. Berman loved sports and was a good baseball and tennis player.

Sam Berman was admitted to the Bar in 1933. His law practice focused on real estate (specifically closings, title examination, and landlord-tenant issues) and probate work. Berman practiced law in these fields largely because of his hearing impairment--he had virtually no hearing in his right ear and could not do trial work. Berman founded Attorneys Title Guarantee Company. Within the Denver community he engaged in professional activities and joined and participated in observant and leadership roles at Beth Joseph Congregation (he was confirmed at Beth haMedrosh Hagodol Congregation).
 
Berman married Blanche Grosinger, a sergeant in the WACS, on December 19, 1948.  His service activity was limited due to his hearing impairment: He served on the local War Board with particular involvement in blood drives. Sam and Blanche Berman had five children: John, Stephen, Martha, Lawrence, and Daniel.  Sam Berman was the sole proprietor of his law practice for his entire career, frequently sharing office space with realty companies. Berman practiced law until 1998. Blanche Berman died on January 11, 2002, and Sam Berman died three on April 10, 2002.</Bio_Org_History>

Sam Berman spent the longest amount of time at the Denver Sheltering Home of any of its residents. He attended Cheltenham School, Lake Junior High, and North High School. The Home, in consideration of Berman’s long service there, sponsored his education at the University of Denver (DU) as an undergraduate and later as a law student. He was admitted to the Bar in 1933, and his law practice focused on real estate (specifically closings, title examination, and landlord-tenant issues) and probate work. Berman founded Attorneys Title Guarantee Company. Within the Denver community he engaged in professional activities and joined and participated in observant and leadership roles at Beth Joseph Congregation (he was confirmed at Beth haMedrosh Hagodol Congregation).
 
Berman married Blanche Grosinger on December 19, 1948.  They had five children: John, Stephen, Martha, Lawrence, and Daniel. Sam Berman was the sole proprietor of his law practice throughout his entire career, frequently sharing office space with realty companies. He practiced law until 1998. Blanche Berman died on January 11, 2002, and Sam Berman died three months later on April 10, 2002.</Bio_Org_History_Biograph._History>

      <Abstract>Leopold H. Guldman was born in Harburg, Bavaria in 1853 and immigrated to the United States in 1870.  He was one of Colorado's leading merchants and philanthropists. Guldman came to the Colorado mountains in search of silver, but found it more profitable to open the Golden Eagle clothing stores in Leadville and Cripple Creek. In 1879, Guldman moved to Denver and opened his third and most successful Golden Eagle enterprise, which for many years was Denver's leading popular-price department store. By 1901, its five-story building occupied most of the block at 16th and Lawrence Streets. Guldman's philanthropy contributed to the growth of National Jewish Hospital (NJH), the Jewish Consumptives' Relief Society (JCRS), Beth Israel Hospital, Temple Emanuel, and the Guldman Community Center, which evolved into today's Denver Jewish Community Center. After Guldman's death in 1936, his store endured hard times and was forced to close in 1941.</Abstract>

      <Abstract>The Fair Cookbook was published by the Ladies of Congregation Emanuel in Denver, Colorado in 1888. It is the earliest known Jewish fundraising cookbook in America. The cookbook was sold at the fair that the Ladies of Temple Emanuel organized in 1888 to pay off the mortgage on the Temple. It is 49 pages in length with 13 sections, and features both traditional Jewish kosher recipes and recipes for non-kosher items as well as the names of individual contributors. 

The collection is a photocopy of the original cookbook, which was stolen from an exhibit sponsored by the Rocky Mountain Jewish Historical Society and Beck Archives in the late 1990s.</Abstract>

      <Abstract>Louis K. Sigman, the owner of K&amp;G packing, the largest independent meat packing plant in Colorado, was the son of East European immigrants. Born in 1881, he moved to Denver as a young boy. To support himself, Louis shined shoes and sold matches and newspapers to earn enought money to bring his parents to Colorado from Russia. In Denver, his father opened Sigman's Grocery in the West Colfax neighborhood. Louis began his meat  business with just one calf and went on to become a well-known philanthropist active in the founding of Rose Hospital and treasurer of the National  Home for Jewish Children. Sigman made headlines when he gave away thousands of pounds of meat to indigent Denver residents as well as kosher meat cuts to his co-religionists during the height of the Great Depression. His sons Sam and Morris worked in the family business and continued the familiy tradition of involvement in philanthropy and social welfare organizations as did his granddaughter Sherrye Sigman Berger.

The collection includes digital copies of photographs and scrapbooks featuring clippings related to Louis Sigman, and Sam and Morris Sigman, as well as  clippings related to the work of Sherrye Sigman Berger.</Abstract>

      <Bio_Org_History>Shul Baer Milstein arrived in Denver in 1884. He was the impetus behind the Jewish agricultural colony at Cotopaxi, Colorado. Nettie Milstein, daughter of Shul Milstein, married her first cousin Jacob Muhlstein in Central City, Colorado. The couple homested near Longmont, Colorado and then farmed near Broomfield, Colorado where they lived for years without running water or indoor plumbing for their family of nine children. The children started school in a one room schoolhouse. The schoolhouse was several miles from the farm and the children either walked or rode horses to school. The family sold their farmland to the Savory Mushroom Company during the Great Depression for $18,000. One of the nine children, Rose Muhlstein, married Samuel Ornstein in 1906 in Denver, Colorado. They were founders of the Zera Abraham Congregation. Samuel Ornstein died in 1958 and Nettie Ornstein died January 17, 1972.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Henry Lowenstein was born Ernst Heinrich Loewenstein on July 4, 1925 in Berlin, Germany to Dr. Max Moses Loewenstein and Marie [Maria] Lilli Margarete Bätge Loewenstein.  Max Loewenstein, called ''Vatchen'' by his children, was Jewish; however, Maria ''Mautzy'' was not.  Growing up in pre-World War II Germany, Henry attended a Jewish school and was a member of a Jewish boy scout group where he learned to survive the Nazi terror.

Max Loewenstein was born in Lessen, West Prussia on May 17, 1885.  He moved to Germany to study medicine and worked as a ships doctor before becoming an army doctor during World War I.  After the war he settled in Berlin where he specialized in dermatology and venereal disease.  In Berlin he met, married, and built a life with Maria Steinberg.

Maria Bätge was born in Tallinn, Estonia on April 9, 1894.  Maria studied art in St. Petersburg, Russia where she married her first husband Erich Steinberg in 1914.  Their daughter, Karin, was born in 1915 in Helsinki, Finland.  The family escaped the Russian Revolution in 1917 by moving to Germany.  After Erich's death in 1920, Maria moved to Berlin to work as an artist and designer.

In 1939, Heinrich Loewenstein [Henry Lowenstein] was relocated from Berlin on the Kindertransport to safety in England where he remained for the duration of World War II.  

Throughout the war, the rest of the Loewenstein family, including Heinrich Loewenstein's [Henry Lowenstein] non-Jewish half-sister Karin Steinberg, remained in Berlin.  The family suffered because they lived in a Jewish household, yet Maria was able to save Max from being transported to concentration camps on several occasions. Many of the Loewenstein's friends and family members died in concentration camps or ghettos.

After the war, Karin Steinberg obtained a position as an assistant to Otto Grotewohl, leader of the Socialist Democrats in Germany.  In this capacity, she was part of a secret meeting in early 1946 between Grotewohl and Wilhem Pieck, leader of the German Communists.  Steinberg learned of their plans against the Western Powers and passed the information to an American contact.  In order to protect the Loewenstein family, the United States government facilitated the family's immigration to the United States in 1946.

In 1947, Heinrich Loewenstein [Henry Lowenstein] joined his family in the United States after emigrating from England.  It was after the family's immigration to the United States that they changed their name to Lowenstein.  Henry Lowenstein served in the Air Force, then attended Yale University Drama School in 1953.  After graduation he was recruited by Helen Bonfils to design and produce shows for the Bonfils Theatre in Denver, Colorado later called the Lowenstein Theatre. He also produced plays for the Denver Civic Theatre until his retirement in 1995. __The Loewenstein family, Henry Lowenstein's paternal ancestors, lived in Lessen, West Prussia.  Levin Loewenstein, his great-grandfather, was granted Prussian citizenship in 1848 and with citizenship was able to choose a last name.  Prior to Levin Loewenstein's citizenship, the family, like all Jews in Eastern Europe, was denied a last name.  Levin's son Emil was a grain merchant married to Ernestine.  Upon Emil's death in 1908, Ernestine continued to operate the business until the area was ceded to Poland in 1918.  Ernestine, called ''Omchen'' by her family, then moved to Berlin, Germany to be near her sons, Max and Georg Loewenstein.  Ernestine died a natural death in 1940 before her son and daughter-in-law, Georg and Alice Loewenstein, were deported to the Lodz Ghetto.

The Bätge family, Henry Lowenstein's maternal ancestors, lived in Tallinn, Estonia.  Ernst Carl Friedrich Bätge, his great-grandfather, was a merchant and served as mayor of Tallinn 1864-1875.  Ernst disinherited his son Dr. Arthur Ernst Bätge when Arthur decided to become a medical doctor rather than join the family's merchant business.  Arthur was married to Therese Sophie Agathe Berg the daughter of a merchant.  Their daughter was Marie Lilli Margarete Bätge Steinberg Loewenstein.

Henry Lowenstein's cousin, Ingrid Lind, was raised by the Loewensteins after her mother died and her Danish father deserted his children. In 1939, Ingrid went to Denmark as she had duel citizenship and a Danish passport. From there she went to Sweden, then across Russia to the Middle East where she joined the British Army. Ingrid was in England at the end of the war.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>The Jewish community in Cheyenne, Wyoming, committed to building a new synagogue around 1950. The leaders of the community, including Bernard Leon Rayor, equally provided the funds for the building. When Mt. Sinai Congregation was completed, B.L. Rayor donated the ark curtains, which were left unused because his name was embroidered on them. The curtains were recently rediscovered in storage. 

B.L. Rayor moved to Cheyenne with his wife Bessie and young family in 1918. As a builder and real estate broker since 1924, he donated the grounds for the elementary school and for the Veterans Hospital. Rayor Avenue was named in his honor. 

B.L. Rayor’s youngest daughter Dorothy and son-in-law Joseph Feldman were committed members of the synagogue. After Joseph Feldman’s death, Dorothy Feldman donated his large collection of Jewish books to the synagogue to start its library. Mrs. Feldman became the synagogue librarian. The synagogue is still active for the small Cheyenne Jewish community.

B.L. Rayor’s youngest son, Harold Rayor, a Cheyenne native, lives in the Denver area with his wife Connie, a Jewish Denver native for generations (her grandmother, whose family were sharecroppers on a horse farm, was born in Denver in 1896). Their oldest two daughters (Linda and Diane) were born in Cheyenne, and the youngest (Janet) in Denver, where they were raised. __Harry Rachofsky, an immigrant from Poland via Manchester, England, was invited to join in a relative’s clothing store in Central City, Colorado. (Harry went on to have a series of unsuccessful general stores in various locations in Colorado; he also purchased a non-productive silver mine in La Plata County in 1916.) Miriam Kobey lived in Central City initially, but moved to Denver for a more observant Jewish life; she became a prominent midwife in Denver. Harry Rachofsky married his niece, Miriam Kobey’s daughter Betsy. Harry and Betsy had six children; their youngest, Bernard Leon, was born in Denver in 1892. Shortly after, the family moved to Durango, where Bernard Leon grew up. In 1909, Bernard Leon and his brothers changed their name from Rachofsky to Rayor to improve job prospects.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The Jewish Family and Children’s Service of Colorado (JFCS) was created in a response to international, national, and local needs of refugees.  The JFCS emerged from two organizations, the National Council of Jewish Women, Denver Section (NCJW), founded in 1893 and the Central Jewish Aid Society of Denver, Colorado, organized in 1915 and incorporated in 1923. Ray David was the first superintendent of the Jewish Aid Society. In 1937, Tillye Levy became a member of the Service to Foreign Born Committee of the NCJW and immediately began organizing resources for Jews who fled the early stages of the Holocaust. The services supplied facilitated the adjustment of the refugees. At Tillye Levy’s request, Isadore Hilb became the first chair of the new Denver Coordinating Committee for Refugees. A. B. Hirshfield was the chair of the job placement committee, Dave Harlem was in charge of creating affidavits, and Surriee Feder Miller was responsible for integrating newcomers into the Denver community. In 1947, the Jewish Family and Children’s Service was created when the boards of the Central Jewish Aid Society and the NCJW committees merged. Sydney Grossman became the newly formed agency’s first president, and Dr. Alfred Neumann, a social worker, became the full-time director. The name was changed to the Jewish Family and Children's Service of Denver in 1954 and became the Jewish Family and Children's Service of Colorado in 1972. The JFCS continued to give relief to the needy and assist refugees in resettling, but also expanded into the field of family and child welfare. The JFCS created the “Denver Plan,” procedures for integrating new residents into the community, which was copied by cities across the United States. The agency hired trained staff to provide service in three areas: family, child, and vocational guidance; service to established residents; and immigrant aid. The agency also handled German reparation money through the Utility Workshop, headed by Mary (Mrs. Sidney) Jacobs. The Utility Workshop produced jobs and services for individuals suffering from emotional or physical handicaps. The services provided by the JFCS continue on through its successor, the Jewish Family Service of Colorado.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __Steve Harris Millmond founded The Mosaic Outdoor Mountain Club in Colorado in reaction to his perception that modern Judaism had lost touch with the outdoors and the environment.  The name, "Mosaic," refers to Moses, and the organization was directed toward the Jewish community, including Jewish singles.  The group's first event, a hike in the Rocky Mountains, was held in December of 1988.  The organization was incorporated as a Colorado nonprofit coporation on 5/11/1989.  Outdoor events, including hiking, canoeing, skiing, and bicycling, were hosted at least several times per month.  Colorado's chapter of the Mosaic Outdoor Mountain Club was the first chapter in an organization that eventually included more than 20 local chapters in three countries.  An international umbrella organization, Mosaic Outdoor Clubs of America, was founded in 1995.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The Isaac Solomon Historic Synagogue Foundation was founded in 2001 with a mission to restore the Beth Jacob Synagogue building and a tent structure on the former campus of the Jewish Consumptives' Relief Society (JCRS) in Lakewood, Colorado.  It was hoped that the restored synagogue could serve as a museum and events center.  The JCRS sanatorium treated mostly Eastern European Jewish tuberculosis patients, and the synagogue played a crucial role in sanatorium life.  The original 1911 structure was replaced in 1926 after a fire in 1920 and is among the oldest equipped synagogues in the Denver area.  It was the first Jewish house of worship in Jefferson County.  The restored tent structure is a furnished example of patient accommodations.  The Foundation board of directors, headed by Bernard and Susan Goldman, negotiated leases with the JCRS successors, the AMC Cancer Research Center and Hospital (AMC) and the Rocky Mountain College of Art and Design (RMCAD).  The Foundation also conducted a historic assessment, raised funds from grants and donations, and completed limited restorations.  The Foundation was disolved in 2013 due to financial challenges.

      <Bio_Org_History>In 2004, Martin Mendelsberg, a professor at the Rocky Mountain College of Art and Design (RMCAD), made his first trip to the Beck Archives at the University of Denver Library to research the cultural and historical roots of the Jewish Consumptives’ Relief Society (JCRS). The JCRS was established in 1904 in Lakewood, Colorado for the treatment of tuberculosis, then the leading cause of death in the United States. The original JCRS campus is now the Rocky Mountain College of Art and Design (RMCAD). As a Professor in the Communications Design Department at RMCAD, Mendelsberg was developing a new course for graphic designers that challenged students to consider the power of storytelling in words and pictures. Access to the Beck archives offered his students the chance to examine thousands of primary source photographs, documents, and artifacts first hand. 

In 2005, the first group of design students enrolled in Mendelsberg’s “Visual Sequencing” course carried out research in the Beck Archives, where they began the process of researching patient files for the purpose of developing compelling stories and histories that would eventually come to fruition in the form of photographic studies, typographic studies and illustrated books. This course project was continued on a yearly base through 2013 and resulted in dozens of beautiful, engaging students artists’ books based on the lives of a number of early JCRS TB patients. The experience of sorting through original documents was transforming, and as one student noted, “It’s exciting to hold these documents in your hands and carefully sort through the dust of history.” Highlighted in this display are six examples of the books the students produced, as well as the JCRS archival materials that inspired their work.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Abstract>The Souvenir and House Programs Collection features souvenir and house programs related to dance productions, dance companies, dance festivals, Broadway musicals, theatre productions, opera companies, ice skating productions, and films. 
A souvenir program is a commercial publication designed to enhance a company or show with photographs, short biographies, company histories and repertory lists. The companies, festivals and productions covered by the programs in the collection are international in scope. A house program is one that is distributed at a performance to members of the audience attending the event.  The house program usually deals with only the specifics of the actual performance itself: title, composer, designer, cast list, and company roster.  
Spanning the 20th century, the programs cover primarily ballet but also include folk dance, flamenco dancing, Highland dancing, tango, and ice dancing. Programs in the collection represent the American Ballet Theatre, Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, Ballet Theatre, Ballet Folklorico de Mexico, Ballet West, the Bolshoi Ballet, Jacobs Pillow Dance Festival, Jose Greco and his Spanish Ballet, the New York City Ballet, the Royal Ballet (London), National Ballet of Canada, among others.  Performers listed in the programs include Anna Pavlova, Marcel Marceau, Sonja Henie, Jose Greco, and Michael Flatly.</Abstract>

      <Bio_Org_History>At the heart of the term ''souvenir'' is the desire ''to remember.'' The desire, however, is tied to a physical object - a seashell recalling an ocean, pressed leaves of a visit home, a ticket stub of an evening in the theater. These are keys to trigger memory.
Souvenirs have been a part of human endeavor since before recorded history, a chance to touch time itself by capturing a moment in a significant object. Mourners used to clip a lock of hair, or lop off a bit of funeral shroud to mark the passing of important personages. Indeed, the invention of the honor guard may have been less a case of homage than defense against desecration.
Whence came the commercial souvenir? Did some ancient Greek traveler bargain for a model pyramid to remember a voyage up the Nile? Did a painted vase from Athens have sentimental value for a young man of classical Rome, completing his studies? We can only guess. Neither theater history nor sociological research reveal when the souvenir program came to be.
But a prime example for both theater and dance must be the 'Balet Comiqve de la Royne,' a 1582 publication ''avec privilege'' from the ''Impremeurs du Roy'' (Adrian le Roy, Robert Ballard, Mamert Patisson). Was this commemoration of a court spectacle, or a desire to exert political propaganda? For sure, this publication, which describes in detail the production (a paean for a new ''golden age'' as exemplified in the marriage of the queen's sister to a royal noble) might just as well have provided a remembrance - a souvenir to any of the courtiers who participated or witnessed the event.
During successive centuries ''airs de ballet'' (booklets of featured tunes) were printed in France. Surely these count as commercial souvenirs (and yes, commercial enterprise and souvenirs have been linked since inception).
But it wasn't until the 18th century and the cult of the performer that theatrical souvenirs became popular. Look at all those lithographs of early ballerinas, gracing sheet music for the newly respectable parlor piano. Surely the next permutation must have been, by then, obvious - a booklet, offered to theater patrons and taking much of the effort out of souvenir mongering. __As a definition, then, a souvenir program could be described as:
(1) a commercial enterprise (often produced as part of a marketing plan)
(2) designed to emphasize a company or show and the personalities connected whether on stage or as creative forces (e.g. author, composer, choreographer or lyricist) with
(3) photographs, short biographies and related information.
In contrast, a house program is one that is distributed at a performance to members of the audience attending the event.  The house program usually deals with only the specifics of the actual performance itself: title, composer, designer, cast list, and company roster.  
At its best a souvenir program can contain accurate and otherwise unavailable company histories, biographical notes and repertory lists. Noted critics were solicited for essays evaluating the company in question. More rarely artists themselves contributed. Anton Dolin, Eugene Loring and Antony Tudor all wrote for the early Ballet Theatre's souvenir books. The exact facts of a dance production (music, libretto, costumes, lighting) can often be found in the lowly souvenir program.
Additionally a souvenir program may contain fine art photography by noted artists, such as George Platt Lynes for the New York City Ballet, or hard-to- find information such as a discography of Philippine music from the Bayanihan Philippine Dance Company. While souvenir programs are predominantly attached to staged shows, they may be issued, too, for exhibitions and gala film openings. (Some programs have virtually no value beyond naming company members.)
The Carson-Brierly Dance Library's holdings comprise an initial 640 items spanning nearly the whole of the 20th century. The earliest, ca. 1906, is devoted to Adeline Genee; one of the most recent is for Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance. The first has a dance history expanded with quotations by Genee; the last merely notes the show was ''Created, choreographed and produced by Michael Flatley,'' with many color photographs of Flatley and the barest mention of other company members.
As a further aid to remembrance, some souvenir programs have newspaper reviews or house programs laid in, or autographs from the performers themselves. __The souvenir and house programs are arranged in alphabetical order by company name or performer's surname. Some performers and some companies have been through several name changes as noted. The programs are under the name as it appears on the program (thus, 'Ballet Theatre' and 'American Ballet Theatre') with one notable exception: Pavlova is under the surname rather than the confusing permutations and partnerships she created.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History_Biograph._History>At the heart of the term ''souvenir'' is the desire ''to remember.'' The desire, however, is tied to a physical object - a seashell recalling an ocean, pressed leaves of a visit home, a ticket stub of an evening in the theater. These are keys to trigger memory.
Souvenirs have been a part of human endeavor since before recorded history, a chance to touch time itself by capturing a moment in a significant object. Mourners used to clip a lock of hair, or lop off a bit of funeral shroud to mark the passing of important personages. Indeed, the invention of the honor guard may have been less a case of homage than defense against desecration.
Whence came the commercial souvenir? Did some ancient Greek traveler bargain for a model pyramid to remember a voyage up the Nile? Did a painted vase from Athens have sentimental value for a young man of classical Rome, completing his studies? We can only guess. Neither theater history nor sociological research reveal when the souvenir program came to be.
But a prime example for both theater and dance must be the 'Balet Comiqve de la Royne,' a 1582 publication ''avec privilege'' from the ''Impremeurs du Roy'' (Adrian le Roy, Robert Ballard, Mamert Patisson). Was this commemoration of a court spectacle, or a desire to exert political propaganda? For sure, this publication, which describes in detail the production (a paean for a new ''golden age'' as exemplified in the marriage of the queen's sister to a royal noble) might just as well have provided a remembrance - a souvenir to any of the courtiers who participated or witnessed the event.
During successive centuries ''airs de ballet'' (booklets of featured tunes) were printed in France. Surely these count as commercial souvenirs (and yes, commercial enterprise and souvenirs have been linked since inception).

      <Scope-Content>The Carson-Brierly Dance Library's Souvenir Program Collection comprises souvenir and house programs related to dance: productions, companies, and festivals; as well as the dance aspects of Broadway musicals, operas, ice skating productions, and films.  A souvenir program is a commercial publication designed to enhance a company or show with photographs and short biographies.  Some programs include company histories and repertory lists.  The companies, festivals and productions covered by the programs in the collection are international in scope representing the United States, Canada, France, England, Scotland, Spain, Australia, Mexico, USSR, Indonesia, Ukraine and many others.
Spanning nearly the whole of the 20th century, the souvenir programs cover primarily ballet, but also folk, flamenco, Highland dancing, tango, ice dancing, tap, and ballroom. Souvenir programs in the collection represent the American Ballet Theatre, Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, Ballet Theatre, Ballet Folklorico de Mexico, Ballet West, the Bolshoi Ballet, Jacobs Pillow Dance Festival, Jose Greco and his Spanish Ballet, the New York City Ballet, the Royal Ballet (London), National Ballet of Canada, among others. Performers in the programs include Anna Pavola, Marcel Marceau, Sonja Henie, Jose Greco, Michael Flatly and others.
Information concerning the music, libretto, costumes and lighting relating to the productions can be located in some programs. Also, some souvenir programs in the collection include newspaper reviews or house programs laid in, or autographs from the performers. The earliest souvenir program, ca. 1906, is devoted to Adeline Genee; one of the most recent is for Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance.</Scope-Content>

      <Abstract>The Colorado Dance Festival was organized in 1978 as a dance film series under the umbrella of the Boulder Dance Alliance. Founder Marda Kim served as artistic director in 1978. In 1980 the film series was renamed the Independent Boulder Dance Festival. The name was again changed in 1982 to the Colorado Dance Festival, and featured workshops, classes and performances. The festival spearheaded the American tap dance revival. Unable to finance further seasons, the festival closed in 2001. Photographs include a series of action stills featuring Blondell Cummings with Keith Terry; Eiko and Koma images as well as David Dorfman Dance.  The collection includes publicity and production photographs used for performer biographies in programs and as publicity for performances during the Colorado Dance Festivals held in Boulder, Colorado. The photographs concentrate on modern dance, but also include outreach and social events sponsored by the festival.</Abstract>

      <Bio_Org_History>The Colorado Dance Festival began as a dance film series under the aegis of the Boulder (Colorado) Dance Alliance in 1978. Marda Kirn was its founder and artistic director for many years. By 1980 the film series became the independent Boulder Dance Festival, a week of classes and performances funded by grants and donations, and using facilities at the University of Colorado. Renamed the Colorado Dance Festival soon after, the enterprise gained a national reputation for presenting new, young performers and companies. During subsequent seasons the festival expanded to a full month of workshops, classes, and performances in a variety of venues. The Colorado Dance Festival was a pioneer in spearheading the American tap dance revival. A legendary 1986 presentation at the Casino Cabaret in Denver’s Five Points (the city’s traditional hub of African-American identity and culture) called “The Great Tap Reunion” presented dancers Eddie Brown, Charles “Honi” Coles, Steven Condos, Jimmy Slyde, and Gregory Hines. A later festival offered some of the younger greats of the genre including a young Savion Glover. The International Tap Association grew out of this impetus and continues to publish a magazine devoted to tap dance aficionados. A performance in 1988 of Robert Davidson’s “Meister Eckhart” introduced audiences to the potential of “aerial dance,” that is, the use of low-flying trapeze technique as a legitimate facet of dance. In the wake of September 11, 2001, the festival was unable to finance further seasons and folded. The Carson-Brierly Dance Library received all the festival’s office files in spring 2002 including its photography archive.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Scope-Content>The Colorado Dance Festival Photograph Collection was established as a working collection of photographs, intended for loaning to various news media for publicity and supporting previews, reviews and features. All of the artists and companies presented by the festival are represented. The collection is particularly rich in modern dance; skimpy in ballet and ethnic forms. The bulk of the photographs are eight inch by ten inch glossy prints though many of the images are duplicated in negative transparencies depending on the needs of various publications. There are numerous 35 mm. color slides as well. Duplicate prints have been weeded; negatives retained. Over 600 entries represent over 1,000 images. The collection includes publicity and production photographs submitted by individuals and dancers either for faculty/performer biographies for programs or as publicity for performances during the Colorado Dance Festival held in Boulder, Colorado. The collection also includes outreach and social events sponsored by the festival.

      <Bio_Org_History>Colorado Ballet, located in Denver,  Colorado is a regional dance company that was conceived as a ballet school, and founded in 1951, by Denver natives Freidann Parker and Lillian Covillo. To showcase their students, the life-long friends established Colorado Concert Ballet in 1961. The Company presented its very first production of The Nutcracker at the Bonfils Theater in Denver to sell-out audiences.
By 1978, Colorado Concert Ballet employed 16 men and women, and had achieved full professional status. The Board of Trustees increased the annual budget to $100,000 and refined the Company’s name. In doing so, Colorado Ballet was born. In 1987 Parker and Covillo conducted a nationwide search, at their own expense, for a new artistic director. With their choice of Martin Fredmann. 
In response to the lagging economy in Denver, Colorado Ballet looked to an emerging national trend among dance companies and entered into an alliance with Tampa Ballet. Through shared expenses, the alliance enabled the companies to develop an artistic product with reduced financial risk. By 1990, Colorado Ballet achieved greater financial stability and community recognition, so the alliance was discontinued to better enable future growth of the Denver Company. The decision reestablished Colorado Ballet as a resident company.
In the 2006-2007 seasons, Gil Boggs, a former American Ballet Theatre principal, began his tenure as artistic director of Colorado Ballet. 
In 2009 Colorado Ballet was the sole recipient of the Colorado Masterpieces program to tour Colorado's Front Range. The program was funded by the Colorado Council on the Arts and the National Endowment for the Arts through their American Masterpieces: Three Centuries of Artistic Genius initiative.
In 2010 Colorado Ballet consisted of 30 professional dancers of national and international acclaim, 17 studio company dancers, a $6.6 million operating budget, an expansive repertoire, and two locations for the Academy of Colorado Ballet.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Dr. Lloyd Shaw was born September 29, 1890 in Denver, CO to William Goodman and Julia Anne (Banker) Shaw.  His parents moved the family to California, where his father was briefly involved in real estate, then back to Denver and eventually to Colorado Springs, where Lloyd Shaw lived for the remainder of his life.  He attended The Colorado College for undergraduate studies.  Immediately after graduating in 1913, he married Dorothy Cory Stott (Dorothy Stott Shaw, November 26, 1891-March 12, 1985), and began a lengthy career as an educator.  In 1916 he was hired to teach at and be principal of Cheyenne Mountain School in the Broadmoor area, and became superintendent of the Cheyenne Mountain School District shortly afterward.  Dorothy was simultaneously hired to be the school librarian.  Lloyd and Dorothy remained at Cheyenne Mountain School until their mutual retirement in June of 1951.  While at Cheyenne Mountain, Shaw pursued a radical transformation of the school’s academic and athletic offerings until they included carpentry, astronomy, Native studies, rodeo, skiing, hiking, and folk dancing, in addition to more traditional subjects. In 1928 and 1937 he was awarded Honorary Doctorates from The Colorado College and the University of Colorado, respectively.   In 1936 Lloyd Shaw took a group of dancers to perform at Central City; the group became known as The Cheyenne Mountain Dancers, and farther-ranging tours commenced shortly afterward, with their first cross-national trip happening in 1939.  Also in 1939, Shaw published his best-known work, “Cowboy Dances,” and with his dancers conducted a demonstration in Chicago for the annual conference of the American Association for Health, Physical Education, and Recreation; together, these generated enough demand that in 1940 he began running summer institutes for educators interested in western square dancing. The classes went on hiatus from 1942-1944 for World War II, but began again in 1945 and continued until after his retirement in 1951.  By the end of the run there were three sessions each summer, including a special invitation-only fellowship in August which continued even after his death; its membership eventually became the nucleus of the Lloyd Shaw Foundation. In 1950 Lloyd Shaw founded a record company, Lloyd Shaw Records, in collaboration with Fred Bergin, owner of Rinx Records.   He passed away on July 18, 1958 and was buried in the Evergreen Cemetery in Colorado Springs.  His wife, Dorothy; a daughter, Doli Shaw (Doli Obee); and Doli’s children, Enid Allison Obee (Enid Cocke) and Kent  David Obee, survived him.
Lloyd Shaw attended local elementary schools in Glendale, California and Denver, Colorado, as well as Colorado Springs, CO; after the family moved to Colorado Springs, he graduated from Colorado Springs High School in 1909.  Following graduation, he attended The Colorado College for four years, graduating in 1913 with a Bachelors of Arts (AB).  During his sophomore year he became engaged to Dorothy Cory Stott, who also graduated in 1913.  Following graduation, Lloyd Shaw was hired to teach science and English courses at Cutler Academy, the preparatory school run by The Colorado College.  When Cutler Academy shut down in 1914, he was hired by the Colorado Springs High School as a biology teacher, simultaneously coaching dramatics both there and at the college.  He remained at Colorado Springs High School from 1914 until 1916, when he quit and became principal of the Cheyenne Mountain School.  In addition, his work there included teaching Senior English as well as coaching sports and dramatics.  In 1917 he wrote The Littlest Wiseman, a Christmas pageant that would be performed by the school annually until his retirement; it was officially published as a book in 1951 and is still being performed.  In 1919 school officials asked Shaw to return to Colorado Springs High School as principal, but he declined; by 1920 he had been promoted to Superintendent of Cheyenne Mountain School District.  In 1928 The Colorado College awarded him an honorary Doctorate, followed by the University of Colorado giving him an honorary Doctorate of Education in 1937.  He retired from the District in 1951 due to health problems, but remained an influential figure in the local community and in the national square dance scene.  In addition to his work as an educator and dance leader, Lloyd Shaw wrote regular newspaper articles.  The first of these were published in 1915 and collected into his book, “Nature Notes of the Pikes Peak Region,” which was published in 1916.  Near the end of his life, from 1956 until 1957, the Colorado Springs Free Press published his daily column, ”Half a Century of Memories.”
Significant organizational memberships and relationships in Shaw’s life included his extended relationship with The Colorado College, where he served as class president, yearbook editor, dramatics coach, and as an Alumni Trustee from 1923-1936 and 1938-1942; he also conducted at least one series of dance courses on the college campus.  He helped set up the first branch of the Colorado Mountain Club outside the city of Denver in 1919, was president of the Winter Night Club in 1937, and was a member of the American Association for Health, Physical Education, and Recreation.  With regard to dance, he was associated with some of the early National Square Dance Conventions, serving as Master of Ceremonies at the 3rd National Convention in 1954, and was on the organizing committee for the National Folk Festival in 1940.  He was the primary teacher, choreographer, and caller for the Cheyenne Mountain Dancers from the 1920s until his retirement, and choreographed the dancing for the 1946 movie “Duel in the Sun.” He initially recorded his own calling with Decca Records and the “Duel in the Sun Orchestra,” but in 1950 started his own label, Lloyd Shaw Records, in conjunction with Fred Bergin; it focused on round dance and folk dance music, but also included square dance tunes.  He worked with Alfred Brown of the Colorado School for the Deaf and Blind to help them create their own square dance exhibition team, and was indirectly associated with the American Square Dance Association, contributing several letters and articles to the periodical “Sets in Order.”  Both of his major dance books, “Cowboy Dances” in 1939 and “The Round Dance Book” in 1947, were published by the Caxton Printers, in Idaho; after his death, this formed the basis for a continued relationship with the Lloyd Shaw Foundation.
Dr. Shaw was the recipient of numerous awards and honors, both during his life and posthumously.  Significant among these are his two honorary doctorates, a 1949 citation from the American Academy of Physical Education for his folk dancing program, the Sets in Order Foundation’s first Silver Spur Award in 1956, induction into the Sets in Order Square Dance Hall of Fame in 1961 as its first member, and a posthumous Milestone Award from CALLERLAB in 1983.  More recently, in October of 2012 he was named to the Cheyenne Mountain School District 12 Hall of Fame.
	Lloyd Shaw had relationships with many, if not most, of the important leaders involved in square and folk dancing during his lifetime.  His initial contact was Elizabeth Burchenal; he also frequently corresponded with and visited Ralph Page in New Hampshire.  Herb Greggorson, whom he met in 1940 during a visit to El Paso, Texas, also became a frequent correspondent and participated in a round robin style letter along with Al Brundage, who attended Shaw’s summer class in 1949.  Other major contacts include Bob Brundage, who attended a class in 1954; and Bob Osgood, whom Shaw met in 1946 during a visit to California.  Dean Edwards, also a successful caller from Colorado Springs, had something of a philosophical rivalry with Lloyd Shaw.  
The Shaw family was also extensively involved with square dancing both during and after Lloyd’s death.  His older brother, Ray Shaw, was a caller in California for the Rip and Snort club where Bob Osgood danced.  Dorothy Shaw became a highly significant figure in the square dance world herself, lecturing widely, helping to start the Lloyd Shaw Foundation, and serving as Executive Secretary until 1979.  Lloyd and Dorothy’s daughter Doli married Donald Jenkins Obee, who served as President of the Foundation from 1965 until 1979; their daughter, Enid Cocke, has served as President since August of 1979. __ __The Lloyd Shaw Foundation was voted into existence in August of 1964, following the yearly Lloyd Shaw Summer Fellowship held at the home of Dorothy Stott Shaw in Colorado Springs, CO.  It was incorporated as a nonprofit organization in Colorado Springs, and the original membership consisted of 46 dance leaders from across the United States and Canada; by 1966 there were over 140 members.  The Foundation is still incorporated in the state of Colorado, but its headquarters address moved to Manhattan, Kansas in 1979.  The stated purpose of the organization is to, “Recall, restore, and teach the folk rhythms of the American people.”  Implicit in the mission is the additional goal of doing so in a manner consistent with the educational and dance philosophies of Lloyd Shaw.  The first President of the Foundation was Don Armstrong, who served from 1964-1965; he stepped down under the conviction that a member of Lloyd Shaw’s family should serve as president.  Donald Jenkins Obee, Shaw’s son-in-law, served as president from 1965 until 1979, and was followed in this position by his daughter Enid Cocke, 1979 to present.  Dorothy Stott Shaw, Lloyd Shaw’s wife, served as Executive Secretary from 1964 until 1979.  Although the Foundation originally drew its membership from the Lloyd Shaw Summer Fellowship attendees, and conducted its annual meeting after the close of each Fellowship until 1978, the two were never officially affiliated.  The Lloyd Shaw Foundation has had significant relationships with a number of other organizations, including the United Square Dancers of America, Legacy, and CALLERLAB, The Country Dance and Song Society, the New England Square Dance Foundation, and international music distributors.  In 1986 the Library of Congress named the Archives Division as a clearing house for square dance materials, and in 1987 the Archives helped form the National Dance Archives Coordinating Committee. 
The Lloyd Shaw Foundation’s primary functions and activities are educational; although it focuses on square and contra dancing, many other dance traditions are represented in its programs.  Under the Foundation’s auspices, college credit-granting workshops were conducted at Colorado State University from 1965 until the mid-1970s, and at other universities and colleges as well; workshops and teacher training courses continue to be held around the country and internationally, and the Foundation and its members have consistently conducted presentations and dances at the request of numerous organizations.  The Foundation has actively produced and revised targeted dance education kits to assist teachers in dance education since 1966, including resources designed specifically for grades from kindergarten through high school as well as special education students.  Other activities have included sponsoring and running dance camps, particularly the Rocky Mountain Dance Roundup in Colorado, Cumberland Gap in Kentucky, and Terpsichore’s Holiday in West Virginia; providing scholarships for members and groups to attend various dance camps around the country and to travel internationally; and providing research and historical services through the Lloyd Shaw Dance Library and the Archives Division.   The Foundation has also acted as a publisher for musical recordings and dance books, and publishes its own journal.  
Since 1967, members of the Board of Directors have served for a maximum of two consecutive three-year terms, with descendants and relatives of Lloyd Shaw being exempt from the term limits.  From 1976 until 2004, the Archives Division existed as an independent entity within the Lloyd Shaw Foundation administrative structure, overseen by its director and the Executive Directors.  The Foundation maintained an office for its mailing operations in Lakewood, CO from 1972 until they were moved to Albuquerque, NM in 1988, where they shared facilities with the Archives Division.  The Archives Division was disbanded after its materials were donated to the University of Denver in 2003. __In 1972 the Lloyd Shaw Foundation Dance Archives was started by Mary D Walsh.  At the time, it consisted of a single 8mm film of E.S. “Red“ Henderson calling for his Spokane, Washington-based performance group, the Silver Spurs.  In August of 1976 the Foundation’s Board of Directors voted to create an official Archives Division; Dr. Litchman was appointed Director, under the direction of the Executive Committee.  By December the Archives was offering photocopies, research services, and a tape recording service; the organizational newsletter, the “Long Shadow,” actively solicited donations of both money and materials.  In 1978 the Board of Directors voted to provide an operating budget and funds for acquisitions.  Prior to and even after the formation of the Archives researchers had access to the Lloyd Shaw Dance Library, which consisted of Lloyd Shaw’s personal collection, at the home of Dorothy Shaw in Colorado Springs, CO.  Some of these resources were later incorporated into the Archives, but many remained in the possession of the family.  The Archives was housed at Dr. Litchman’s home in Albuquerque, NM until 1982.  In 1982 it was shifted into a renovated chicken coop, and moved again in 1988 to a local dance studio purchased by the Foundation.  Dr. Litchman began negotiations to permanently move the Lloyd Shaw Foundation Dance Archives to the University of Denver in 2002, and the transition was completed in 2003.</Bio_Org_History>

Following graduation, Lloyd Shaw was hired to teach science and English courses at Cutler Academy, the preparatory school run by The Colorado College.  When Cutler Academy shut down in 1914, he was hired by the Colorado Springs High School as a biology teacher, simultaneously coaching dramatics both there and at the college.  He remained at Colorado Springs High School from 1914 until 1916, when he quit and became principal of the Cheyenne Mountain School.  In addition, his work there included teaching Senior English as well as coaching sports and dramatics.  In 1917 he wrote The Littlest Wiseman, a Christmas pageant that would be performed by the school annually until his retirement; it was officially published as a book in 1951 and is still being performed.  In 1919 school officials asked Shaw to return to Colorado Springs High School as principal, but he declined; by 1920 he had been promoted to Superintendent of Cheyenne Mountain School District.  In 1928 The Colorado College awarded him an honorary Doctorate, followed by the University of Colorado giving him an honorary Doctorate of Education in 1937.  He retired from the District in 1951 due to health problems, but remained an influential figure in the local community and in the national square dance scene.  In addition to his work as an educator and dance leader, Lloyd Shaw wrote regular newspaper articles.  The first of these were published in 1915 and collected into his book, “Nature Notes of the Pikes Peak Region,” which was published in 1916.  Near the end of his life, from 1956 until 1957, the Colorado Springs Free Press published his daily column, ”Half a Century of Memories.”
Significant organizational memberships and relationships in Shaw’s life included his extended relationship with The Colorado College, where he served as class president, yearbook editor, dramatics coach, and as an Alumni Trustee from 1923-1936 and 1938-1942; he also conducted at least one series of dance courses on the college campus.  He helped set up the first branch of the Colorado Mountain Club outside the city of Denver in 1919, was president of the Winter Night Club in 1937, and was a member of the American Association for Health, Physical Education, and Recreation.  With regard to dance, he was associated with some of the early National Square Dance Conventions, serving as Master of Ceremonies at the 3rd National Convention in 1954, and was on the organizing committee for the National Folk Festival in 1940.  He was the primary teacher, choreographer, and caller for the Cheyenne Mountain Dancers from the 1920s until his retirement, and choreographed the dancing for the 1946 movie “Duel in the Sun.” He initially recorded his own calling with Decca Records and the “Duel in the Sun Orchestra,” but in 1950 started his own label, Lloyd Shaw Records, in conjunction with Fred Bergin; it focused on round dance and folk dance music, but also included square dance tunes.  He worked with Alfred Brown of the Colorado School for the Deaf and Blind to help them create their own square dance exhibition team, and was indirectly associated with the American Square Dance Association, contributing several letters and articles to the periodical “Sets in Order.”  Both of his major dance books, “Cowboy Dances” in 1939 and “The Round Dance Book” in 1947, were published by the Caxton Printers, in Idaho; after his death, this formed the basis for a continued relationship with the Lloyd Shaw Foundation.
Dr. Shaw was the recipient of numerous awards and honors, both during his life and posthumously.  Significant among these are his two honorary doctorates, a 1949 citation from the American Academy of Physical Education for his folk dancing program, the Sets in Order Foundation’s first Silver Spur Award in 1956, induction into the Sets in Order Square Dance Hall of Fame in 1961 as its first member, and a posthumous Milestone Award from CALLERLAB in 1983.  More recently, in October of 2012 he was named to the Cheyenne Mountain School District 12 Hall of Fame.
	Lloyd Shaw had relationships with many, if not most, of the important leaders involved in square and folk dancing during his lifetime.  His initial contact was Elizabeth Burchenal; he also frequently corresponded with and visited Ralph Page in New Hampshire.  Herb Greggorson, whom he met in 1940 during a visit to El Paso, Texas, also became a frequent correspondent and participated in a round robin style letter along with Al Brundage, who attended Shaw’s summer class in 1949.  Other major contacts include Bob Brundage, who attended a class in 1954; and Bob Osgood, whom Shaw met in 1946 during a visit to California.  Dean Edwards, also a successful caller from Colorado Springs, had something of a philosophical rivalry with Lloyd Shaw.  
The Shaw family was also extensively involved with square dancing both during and after Lloyd’s death.  His older brother, Ray Shaw, was a caller in California for the Rip and Snort club where Bob Osgood danced.  Dorothy Shaw became a highly significant figure in the square dance world herself, lecturing widely, helping to start the Lloyd Shaw Foundation, and serving as Executive Secretary until 1979.  Lloyd and Dorothy’s daughter Doli married Donald Jenkins Obee, who served as President of the Foundation from 1965 until 1979; their daughter, Enid Cocke, has served as President since August of 1979.</Bio_Org_History_Biograph._History>
      <Bio_Org_History_Org._Expansion>In 1972 the Lloyd Shaw Foundation Dance Archives was started by Mary D Walsh.  At the time, it consisted of a single 8mm film of E.S. “Red“ Henderson calling for his Spokane, Washington-based performance group, the Silver Spurs.  In August of 1976 the Foundation’s Board of Directors voted to create an official Archives Division; Dr. Litchman was appointed Director, under the direction of the Executive Committee.  By December the Archives was offering photocopies, research services, and a tape recording service; the organizational newsletter, the “Long Shadow,” actively solicited donations of both money and materials.  In 1978 the Board of Directors voted to provide an operating budget and funds for acquisitions.  Prior to and even after the formation of the Archives researchers had access to the Lloyd Shaw Dance Library, which consisted of Lloyd Shaw’s personal collection, at the home of Dorothy Shaw in Colorado Springs, CO.  Some of these resources were later incorporated into the Archives, but many remained in the possession of the family.  The Archives was housed at Dr. Litchman’s home in Albuquerque, NM until 1982.  In 1982 it was shifted into a renovated chicken coop, and moved again in 1988 to a local dance studio purchased by the Foundation.  Dr. Litchman began negotiations to permanently move the Lloyd Shaw Foundation Dance Archives to the University of Denver in 2002, and the transition was completed in 2003.</Bio_Org_History_Org._Expansion>
      <Bio_Org_History_Organiz._History>The Lloyd Shaw Foundation was voted into existence in August of 1964, following the yearly Lloyd Shaw Summer Fellowship held at the home of Dorothy Stott Shaw in Colorado Springs, CO.  It was incorporated as a nonprofit organization in Colorado Springs, and the original membership consisted of 46 dance leaders from across the United States and Canada; by 1966 there were over 140 members.  The Foundation is still incorporated in the state of Colorado, but its headquarters address moved to Manhattan, Kansas in 1979.  The stated purpose of the organization is to, “Recall, restore, and teach the folk rhythms of the American people.”  Implicit in the mission is the additional goal of doing so in a manner consistent with the educational and dance philosophies of Lloyd Shaw.  The first President of the Foundation was Don Armstrong, who served from 1964-1965; he stepped down under the conviction that a member of Lloyd Shaw’s family should serve as president.  Donald Jenkins Obee, Shaw’s son-in-law, served as president from 1965 until 1979, and was followed in this position by his daughter Enid Cocke, 1979 to present.  Dorothy Stott Shaw, Lloyd Shaw’s wife, served as Executive Secretary from 1964 until 1979.  Although the Foundation originally drew its membership from the Lloyd Shaw Summer Fellowship attendees, and conducted its annual meeting after the close of each Fellowship until 1978, the two were never officially affiliated.  The Lloyd Shaw Foundation has had significant relationships with a number of other organizations, including the United Square Dancers of America, Legacy, and CALLERLAB, The Country Dance and Song Society, the New England Square Dance Foundation, and international music distributors.  In 1986 the Library of Congress named the Archives Division as a clearing house for square dance materials, and in 1987 the Archives helped form the National Dance Archives Coordinating Committee. 
The Lloyd Shaw Foundation’s primary functions and activities are educational; although it focuses on square and contra dancing, many other dance traditions are represented in its programs.  Under the Foundation’s auspices, college credit-granting workshops were conducted at Colorado State University from 1965 until the mid-1970s, and at other universities and colleges as well; workshops and teacher training courses continue to be held around the country and internationally, and the Foundation and its members have consistently conducted presentations and dances at the request of numerous organizations.  The Foundation has actively produced and revised targeted dance education kits to assist teachers in dance education since 1966, including resources designed specifically for grades from kindergarten through high school as well as special education students.  Other activities have included sponsoring and running dance camps, particularly the Rocky Mountain Dance Roundup in Colorado, Cumberland Gap in Kentucky, and Terpsichore’s Holiday in West Virginia; providing scholarships for members and groups to attend various dance camps around the country and to travel internationally; and providing research and historical services through the Lloyd Shaw Dance Library and the Archives Division.   The Foundation has also acted as a publisher for musical recordings and dance books, and publishes its own journal.  
Since 1967, members of the Board of Directors have served for a maximum of two consecutive three-year terms, with descendants and relatives of Lloyd Shaw being exempt from the term limits.  From 1976 until 2004, the Archives Division existed as an independent entity within the Lloyd Shaw Foundation administrative structure, overseen by its director and the Executive Directors.  The Foundation maintained an office for its mailing operations in Lakewood, CO from 1972 until they were moved to Albuquerque, NM in 1988, where they shared facilities with the Archives Division.  The Archives Division was disbanded after its materials were donated to the University of Denver in 2003.</Bio_Org_History_Organiz._History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Suzanne Shelton Buckley was born in Wichita Falls, Texas on April 27, 1946, the daughter of Elsa Barnes Shelton and Glenn Elbert Shelton. She received a Bachelor of Arts with a major in English from the University of Texas at Austin in May 1968. From 1968 to 1970 she was employed as a writer for The Houston Post, in Houston, Texas. In September 1970, she entered the Graduate School in Austin and was awarded the degree of Master of Arts in American Studies in 1973. She was then employed as a dance critic for Texas Monthly and Dance Magazine, where she worked until the mid-1980s. Shelton received her doctorate in American Studies at the University of Texas at Austin in 1980. Suzanne Shelton wrote her dissertation and manuscript on Ruth St. Denis (1878-1968), a seminal figure in modern dance. Her dissertation was published by Doubleday in 1981 as Divine Dancer: A Biography of Ruth St. Denis. After receiving her doctorate, she taught in the American Studies Department at the University of Texas at Austin until the mid-1980s. 

Suzanne Shelton became interested in Ruth St. Denis when she saw Ruth St. Denis as Isis on Egyptian Deity Cigarette packages. Ruth St. Denis is considered to be the mother of American modern dance and introduced Eastern dance forms to Americans. Ms. Shelton's book Divine Dancer covers the dancer's life and includes her marriage and long-time partnership with Ted Shawn, her affair with a Chinese diplomat Sun Nung Au-Young, her world tours and choreography of specific dances. Ted Shawn (1892-1971) was a divinity student at the University of Denver in 1910 when he began dancing. He was expelled the following year because dancing was discouraged at the University, which was still a Methodist university. In 1920 St. Denis and Shawn founded the Denishawn School. A number of notable modern dancers, including Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey, and Charles Weidman, studied at the school. __Suzanne Shelton, a long-time resident of Austin, Texas was married to John Buckley, M.D. and had one daughter. After her husband died in the mid-1980s, Suzanne and her daughter moved to India, where she became director of an educational foundation. Suzanne Shelton Buckley is still director of the foundation and continues to live in India.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Provenance>Materials in this collection were assembled and generated by Suzanne Shelton Buckley as she researched and wrote her doctoral thesis on the dancer, Ruth St. Denis (1978-1985).  This collection of materials was subsequently acquired for the Carson-Brierly Dance Library by Glenn Giffin, who was at that time curator of the collections.  It is believed that the materials came directly from Suzanne Shelton Buckley to the Carson-Brierly Dance Library and were received by Glenn Giffin in the late-1980s, possibly 1988.</Provenance>

      <Abstract>The Jane McLean Papers contain a selection of photographs, newspaper clippings, programs and other dance related ephemera covering the careers of both Jane McLean (1908-1990) and her elder brother Edward McLean (1905-1982).  Both of the McLeans were Colorado natives who traveled to New Yori City in the mid-1920s to study dance, eventually becoming acquainted with many notable dance figures of the day: Ruth St. Denis, Ted Shawn, Martha Graham, Agnes DeMille, etc.  Edward suffered a severe back injury that effectively ended his dance career in 1934.  Jane toured nationally as a solo performer (1931-1952).  She continued to study and teach modern dance in New York before moving to Denver, Colorado in 1949 and then to Casper, Wyoming.  In Wyoming, from approximately 1951-1956, Jane established a school and directed a modern dance company (1949-1954) of her own before returning to Denver, Colorado in 1959.  She continued to teach modern dance, with an emphasis on Graham technique, at various locations around Denver until shortly before her death in 1990.</Abstract>

      <Bio_Org_History>Mary Jane McLean was born in Victor, Colorado on October 3, 1908 where her father operated a cattle ranch and mine. She was one of four children along with Edward McLean (1905-1982), Josephine ''Jordie'' Elizabeth McLean Kehoe Chilson (1916-1997) and Francis McLean born to Michael George McLean and Antoinette Sauer McLean.  The family appears to have lived in different locations in Colorado and in Santa Fe, New Mexico before finally settling in Denver, Colorado where both Jane and Edward graduated from Cathedral High School.  
Jane and her brother, Edward first studied ballet with Lillian Cushing in Denver.  Following the lead of her elder brother Edward, who had decided at an early age to become a professional dancer, Jane and Edward McLean began performing ethnic and American Indian based dances in the early 1920s.  The two traveled to NYC in Sept, 1922 with a letter of introduction from B.T.S. Hare of Santa Fe, New Mexico to the noted American modernist painter, Walt Kuhn (1877-1949). Whether this introduction was productive in arranging for them to perform their American Indian dances is not yet known, but it does point out that Jane and Edward McLean were capable of utilizing many acquaintances in order to further their respective dancing careers.  
The dance company of Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, known as Denishawn toured fairly often through Denver, Colorado in years: 1919, 1920, 1922 and 1925.  It is probable that the McLeans saw this company during their Denver performances.  Edward eventually did dance with the Denishawn company during their American tour of 1926-1927.  At this time, Jane continued to study ballet with Luigi Albertieri and Marie Gamberelli (both former teachers of Lillian Cushing) in NYC.  This was a productive period for the brother and sister with Edward traveling to Germany to study German modern dance with Gret Palucca (1929-1931) and touring Europe as a performer of American Indian dances.  Jane gave her first solo recital in NYC at the La Verne Theater under the sponsorship of Martha Graham, Agnes DeMille and John Murray Anderson in 1929. __From 1927 to 1934 the two siblings also performed together in recitals in Denver, Santa Fe and other cities in the southwest.  In 1931 Edward established a dance school in Kansas City, Kansas.  The two also operated a dancing school of sorts in Santa Fe, New Mexico (1929-1933) and were known for their annual production of the ''Santa Fe Follies'' (1928-1930).  In 1934 Edward McLean severely injured his back during a rehearsal, thereby effectively ending his career.  He went on to study, teach and work as a well known bookbinder for, among others, the Folger Shakespeare Library, the Detroit Public Library, Denver Public Library, Duke University and the University of Denver until his death in Ouray, Colorado in 1982.  Jane McLean continued dancing, eventually performing with the Graham Company for two of their concerts.  She was part of the assistant dance group who supported Martha Graham during her ground breaking Carnegie Hall performance on October 11, 1938.  Another member of this group was Betty Bloomer, later Mrs. Gerald R. Ford.  Throughout the remainder of the 1930s and into the 1940s Jane McLean continued to teach and tour as a solo artist across the United States and into Canada.  The motivation for much of her creative output was based on her relationship to Martha Graham and the Graham technique.  In 1949 she reestablished a base in Denver, Colorado and over a five year period worked in the Casper, Wyoming area, where from 1951-1956 she directed a school and established the Jane McLean Dance Company (1949-1954).  Of note was her recognition of contemporary emerging modern dance icons, Merce Cunningham and John Cage.  According to Carolyn Brown's book: ''Chance and Circumstance: Twenty Years with Cage and Cunningham'' (2007), Jane McLean was responsible for arranging for Merce Cunningham to teach a master class in her Denver studio in April 1951.  From 1959 until her death in 1990, Jane McLean continued to teach modern dance, especially the Graham technique in the Denver Metro area.  She was married and divorced from the photographer, Myron Tanenbaum (1912-1987).</Bio_Org_History>

      <Provenance>Items in this collection were assembled by Mary Jane McLean-Tanenbaum (1908-1990) from materials generated by her and her brother, Edward McLean (1905-1982).  This collection of materials was subsequently acquired for the Carson-Brierly Dance Library by Glenn Giffin, who was at that time curator of the collections.  It is believed that the materials came directly from Jane McLean-Tanenbaum to the Carson-Brierly Dance Library and were received by Glenn Giffin, probably in 1989.</Provenance>

      <Scope-Content>The collection documents the professional activities of the modern dancer and teacher, Jane McLean and to a lesser extent that of her brother the dancer, Edward McLean.  Two scrapbooks kept by Jane McLean are loosely arranged in chronological order.  The first scrapbook contains newspaper clippings, photographs, reviews, programs and publicity material, relating to McLean's performing activities.  These include information on her solo concerts (1929, 1931-1952), performances in conjunction with her brother, Edward  (1927-1934), her involvement with Martha Graham's performances at Carnegie Hall and the Alvin Theatre, NYC (1938).  The second scrapbook appears to have been generated by McLean when she moved to Casper, Wyoming in 1951.  This scrapbook contains newspaper clippings, reviews and photographs pertaining to her activities as a teacher of modern dance in Wyoming (1951-1956) and the formation of the Jane McLean Dance Company (1949-1954).  Loose items, such as newspaper clippings, photographs, letters, brochures, etc. are interfiled within each scrapbook.  A separate file folder contains items that provide similar documentation including a letter of introduction to the painter Walt Kuhn (1922) and Jane McLean's contract to appear in Ruth Page's production of "Cinderella" (Pantomime in Three Scenes) at His Majesty's Theatre in Montreal, Canada in December 1931.  In addition, there is also a prospectus for the dance school that Edward McLean established in Kansas City, Kansas in 1931.  Later materials included letters written by Jane McLean (1970s) as well as a typescript of an undated essay: "Dance thru the Ages" that she had written sometime in the 1940s or early 1950s.  There are also photocopies of Edward, Jane and their sister, Jordie Chilson's obituaries (1985, 1990, 1997).  Other large loose materials include  an assortment of press clippings on Martha Graham as well as a collection of informational posters on a Modern Dance Symposium where Jane McLean was a panelist and teacher that was held in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1956.</Scope-Content>

      <Bio_Org_History>Larry Boyette, born William Lawrence Boyette on May 3, 1924 in Four Oaks, North Carolina was the youngest child of Sidney and Irene Beard Boyette.  In the 1940’s (probably after military service) he attended the University of North Carolina earning a B.A. degree in Theatre.  A student of Margaret Craske, Anthony Tudor and Boris Romanoff, Larry Boyette subsequently danced with the Metropolitan Opera Ballet for nine years (ca.1947-1956).  While at the Met, he performed on live television with the ballerina, Mia Slavenska for the Gala Opening of the 1954-1955 Met Opera Season in a ballet excerpted from the opera ''Aida.''  Boyette also appeared briefly on Broadway (ca.1956-1957) before joining (American) Ballet Theatre (1957-1959).  After performing with ABT, Boyette, along with fellow ABT alumnus George Tomal, moved to Denver, Colorado in 1959.  Both Boyette and Tomal became joint-directors of the Ballet Theatre School of Denver.  The school had been established in Denver in the early 1950's as a satellite school for the Ballet Theatre company and was later renamed Ballet Arts Center. __From 1959 until ca.1967 (when Georga Tomal left Denver and the co-directorship of the school) both Boyette and Tomal worked not only as instructors at the school, but also as choreographers for, among others, the Bonfils Theatre, Denver Lyric Opera and at the University of Colorado, Boulder.  It was also during this time that the ''Ballet Arts Performing Fund'' and the ''Ballet Arts Company'' were established.  Two additional satellite studios were founded in South-Denver and Boulder, Colorado in the mid-1960’s.  Starting in 1963, Tomal and Boyette had also alternated as an instructors of dance at the University of Colorado. After Tomal's departure, Boyette continued at the university until his retirement from CU in 1991.  
In 1973, Larry Boyette established the non-profit organization, ''Ballet Arts Foundation,'' devoted to the development of ballet in Colorado and the Rocky Mountain area. The purpose of the Ballet Arts Foundation was to develop taste and encourage appreciation for qualified, artistically sound, professional ballet performance.  The Foundation was also concerned with providing opportunities for young people to study with teachers of extraordinary merit, especially in the Cecchetti technique, sponsoring master classes and developing dance demonstrations to sensitize students in the public schools to the values of ballet. Finally, the Foundation believed in providing opportunities for young students to perform works in the different modes of ballet with dancers/choreographers of national and international reputation, and encouraged students to create original choreography, to be realized in performance.  The foundation's name was eventually changed to ''Foundation for Public Education in Ballet Arts,'' and finally to ''Ballet Arts Theatre'' in 1983. Between 1978 and 1984, Ballet Arts Theatre performed in at least twenty-five productions with the Denver Symphony Orchestra at Boettcher Concert Hall, including Kids Concerts. 
Although Boyette sold his Ballet Arts studios in 1984, he continued to teach ballet through the beginning of year 2004.  Larry Boyette died in Denver, Colorado on March 16, 2004 of congestive heart failure at the age of 80.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The International Choreographed Ballroom Dance Association was started in response to events at the August, 1976 National Square Dance Convention in Anaheim, CA.  The originally proposed name was “National Round Dance Board of Governors,” which was later modified to the National Round Dance Board of Review; on July 27, 1977 the Universal Round Dance Council was created, the existing Board was selected as the leadership, and on July 28th the Board voted to change its name to become the Board of Directors of the Universal Round Dance Council (URDC).  The group absorbed the National Carousel Clubs organization in 1999.  In 2007 the bylaws were amended by a membership vote and the URDC officially became the International Choreographed Ballroom Dance Association (ICBDA).
The original formal proposal for what became the ICBDA was sent from Frank and Iris Gilbert under the auspices of their National Carousels Round Dancing Clubs, Inc., asking selected dance leaders to create a governing body capable of sponsoring conventions dedicated to advanced-level round dancing,  supporting round dancing activities in general, and standardizing the teaching of dance figures across the United States.  The new organization was proposed to start in December of 1976 as the National Round Dance Board of Governors; by May of 1977 the organization was operating as the National Round Dance Board of Review.  
The first National Round Dance Festival was held from July 28-30,1977 in Kansas City, MO.  It was organized and sponsored by the National Carousel Clubs and the Gilberts, with support from the National Round Dance Board of Review.  On July 27, 1977 a vote was taken by convention attendees to found a new organization, called the Universal Round Dance Council, or URDC, to support round dance events in the future, particularly an ongoing series of national conventions.  Other goals were to improve communication, improve the quality of dance instruction and choreography, and to generally promote the well-being of round dancing as an activity.  Membership would be open to both dancers and teachers, at any level of experience.  The National Round Dance Board of Review was selected to serve as the Board of Directors, with an executive committee; Roy Stier was elected as chairman.  On July 28, 1977, the National Round Dance Board of Review met and officially changed their name to the Board of Directors of the Universal Round Dance Council.  Articles of incorporation and the enactment of bylaw documents were discussed starting at this time, but took until the next convention to be finalized and voted into place at the first official meeting of the Universal Round Dance Council in July of 1978.
	As its primary purpose, in 1977 the URDC immediately took over the National Carousel Clubs' role in planning the convention, which was renamed the National Round Dance Convention for 1978.  The first four conventions were held in Kansas City, MO; since then the location has changed yearly.  The sites with numerous visits are Winston-Salem, NC; San Antonio, TX; San Jose, CA; and Joplin, MO.  Denver, CO and Grand Rapids, MI have each hosted the convention more than once.  The convention name was changed again in 1985 when the 9th Annual Convention was held in Canada and it became the International Round Dance Convention.  Starting in 2008 the International Choreographed Ballroom Dance Association renamed the conventions as the “ICBDA Annual Convention.”  The numbering sequence has remained consistent despite the name changes.
	The Universal Round Dance Council’s second primary activities were publishing a newsletter and a technical manual.  The first semi-monthly newsletter was released in September of 1977, edited by Roy Stier as Executive Chairman.  Sue Riley and her husband Bob took over the editorship beginning with the July, 1981 issue, and she remained editor until 2007.  In February of 1982 the newsletter became titled, “As the World Goes Round.”  Publication of the newsletter was semi-monthly until September of 2004, when it became quarterly.  In September of 2007 the publication’s name became Dancer’s Gazette, and with the first 2008 issue went to a purely digital format.
The URDC’s goal of promoting quality instruction and choreography was supported with publication in June, 1978 of the URDC Encyclopedia and Reference Manual.  It was continually expanded, revised, updated, and reprinted by the Technical Advisory Board (Technical Advisory Committee starting in October 1987), led by Frank and Iris Gilbert until mid-1985.
Over the years the URDC and ICBDA have pursued improved relations with other dance organizations, notably Roundalab, and also joined the ARTS coalition.  In 1998-1999 they absorbed the National Carousel Clubs and in 2000 donated a large amount of associated material to the Lloyd Shaw Foundation Archives.</Bio_Org_History>

	As its primary purpose, in 1977 the URDC immediately took over the National Carousel Clubs' role in planning the convention, which was renamed the National Round Dance Convention for 1978.  The first four conventions were held in Kansas City, MO; since then the location has changed yearly.  The sites with numerous visits are Winston-Salem, NC; San Antonio, TX; San Jose, CA; and Joplin, MO.  Denver, CO and Grand Rapids, MI have each hosted the convention more than once.  The convention name was changed again in 1985 when the 9th Annual Convention was held in Canada and it became the International Round Dance Convention.  Starting in 2008 the International Choreographed Ballroom Dance Association renamed the conventions as the “ICBDA Annual Convention.”  The numbering sequence has remained consistent despite the name changes.
	The Universal Round Dance Council’s second primary activities were publishing a newsletter and a technical manual.  The first semi-monthly newsletter was released in September of 1977, edited by Roy Stier as Executive Chairman.  Sue Riley and her husband Bob took over the editorship beginning with the July, 1981 issue, and she remained editor until 2007.  In February of 1982 the newsletter became titled, “As the World Goes Round.”  Publication of the newsletter was semi-monthly until September of 2004, when it became quarterly.  In September of 2007 the publication’s name became Dancer’s Gazette, and with the first 2008 issue went to a purely digital format.
The URDC’s goal of promoting quality instruction and choreography was supported with publication in June, 1978 of the URDC Encyclopedia and Reference Manual.  It was continually expanded, revised, updated, and reprinted by the Technical Advisory Board (Technical Advisory Committee starting in October 1987), led by Frank and Iris Gilbert until mid-1985.
Over the years the URDC and ICBDA have pursued improved relations with other dance organizations, notably Roundalab, and also joined the ARTS coalition.  In 1998-1999 they absorbed the National Carousel Clubs and in 2000 donated a large amount of associated material to the Lloyd Shaw Foundation Archives.</Bio_Org_History_Organiz._History>

      <Bio_Org_History>John Fagg Foster was born on September 6, 1907 in Blue Ridge, Texas.  He seldom used his first given name, and was known throughout his long career as J. Fagg Foster.  He received a bachelor’s degree in 1935 from East Texas Teachers College, and earned a master’s in education from the University of Texas in 1938.  

He was teaching at the University of Texas in 1941 when he became involved in a controversy over academic freedom.  He and another colleague attended an anti-Fair Labor Standards Act rally and asked to speak in favor of the Act.  Politics intruded, and both Foster and his friend were fired.  The President of the university, Dr. Home Price Rainey, defended the two professors’ right to speak publicly, and he was also fired.  

Foster moved to Ohio to teach at Kenyon College.  There he was chosen by the Federal Housing Authority in Cleveland to be an economist, and served in the Office of Economic Warfare before enlisting in the Army during World War II.  After the war he finished his PhD at the University of Texas before joining the faculty at the University of Denver in 1946.  Between that time and his retirement in June, 1976, he taught and became a well-known speaker and economic thinker.  In 1951-52, he took a leave of absence from the University of Denver to serve as Director of Industrial Relations Analysis for the Federal Wage Stabilization Board, Region 11.  After he returned to the University, he continued to consult for business and government entities.  

Foster had one daughter by his first marriage.  He married Gladys Parker on August 23, 1950.  They raised three children.  He established the Fagg Foster Scholarship Fund in the Economics Department of the University of Denver.  Foster developed lung disease in his later years and died in July 1985.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Alexander Malcolm Richmond was born in 1889 in Chicago, Illinois. As a young man he spent time in Nebraska and South Dakota, entering the employment of the railroad in 1905. He arrived in Denver, Colorado in 1922 and served as a fireman, carpenter, or carman with the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy lines until his retirement in 1949. His employment records indicate he became a helper in January, 1926 and a carman in January, 1937. The time of his most active service with the union, Main Line Lodge, No. 146, Denver, Colorado of the Brotherhood Railway Carmen of America (BRCA) began in 1940 when he was a local committeeman and subsequently, local chairman in February, 1944 of the shop committee at the New Shops. As local chairman, Richmond forwarded the petitions, complaints, and grievances of the union to national officers. In 1949 he became an executive board member of the Joint Protective Board (BRCA) and the same year he attended its convention as a delegate.

Richmond died July 1, 1957 and was survived by his wife, two daughters, one son, three sisters, one brother, and four grandchildren.

The BRCA was founded in 1888 and affiliated with the AFA (now the AFL/CIO) during Richmond's tenure as local representative. It changed its name in 1968 to the Brotherhood Railway Carmen of the United States &amp; Canada.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Scope-Content>The Alexander M. Richmond Papers cover the activities of Main Line Lodge, No. 146, Denver, Colorado, of the Brotherhood Railway Carmen of America during the years he was particularly active in the lodge, 1940-1951. Members of the local lodge worked as painters, carmen, carpenters, painter helpers, upholsterers, or coach cleaners. Topics covered in detail are union activities during World War II, labor relations in the postwar period, jurisdictional disputes with other unions, concerns for safety, and contract violations. Extensive correspondence was carried on with national union officials and copies of letters sent as well as replies received are included. Also included are the printed notices, brochures, and announcements issued by the national union informing locals of activities, negotiations, and projects undertaken or contemplated for the future. Special attention should be drawn to the employment records maintained by the lodge between 1940-1951. Wage rates for men and women, vacation assignments, and seniority disputes provide a picture of working conditions at the shops in Denver during this period.</Scope-Content>

      <Bio_Org_History>Howard Jenkins, Jr. was born on June 16, 1915 in Denver, Colorado, the third child of Howard and Nellie Jenkins. He graduated from the University of Denver in 1936 and from the University's College of Law in 1941. Although he was not the first African American to practice law in Colorado, he was the first African-American to pass the Colorado Bar Examination. In 1940 he married Alice Elaine Brown, the daughter of a prominent African-American minister. She graduated from the University of Denver in 1937 and was the first African-American to teach in the Denver public schools. Howard Jenkins, Jr. died in 2003 and was survived by his wife and two sons and a daughter. __Howard Jenkins became interested in law when he accompanied his best friend to watch his friend's father, Sam Cary, try court cases. Sam Cary was one of the first African-American lawyers in Denver. Jenkins practiced law in Denver until 1946, first in private practice, then in the Denver Office of Price Administration with Edward E. Pringle and Max Melville, then at the Denver War Production Board with James C. Flanigan and Edward Scheunemann. In 1943 Jenkins was appointed Regional Attorney for the National War Labor Board, and in 1945 its Chief Regional Enforcement Officer.  Jenkins then went to work in Washington, D.C. for William Willard Wirtz on the National Wage Stabilization Board, and joined the faculty at Howard University School of Law.  As a law professor he helped prepare briefs for the U.S. Supreme Court to desegregate the railroads and the public schools, including the landmark case of Brown v. Board of Education. In 1956, Jenkins became the special assistant to the Solicitor of Labor. While special assistant, he was intimately involved in drafting and passing the ''Landrum-Griffin'' Labor Reform Act, known as the ''Employees' Bill of Rights.'' In 1959, Jenkins was named Director of the Office of Regulations at the Bureau of Labor-Management Reports. In 1962, he was named Assistant Commissioner of the Bureau and became the highest-ranking African-American attorney in the federal government. In 1963, Jenkins became the first African-American to be appointed to the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) when nominated by President John F. Kennedy. Jenkins was reappointed by three subsequent presidents and served on the NLRB for 20 years.

Howard Jenkins, Jr. had a substantial impact on labor law during his years of service. His mission was ''to help them discover blacks in the industrial work force, and to get it firmly fixed in our national labor policy that discrimination on the basis of race or sex is an unfair labor practice.'' He wrote the majority opinion in the 1964 watershed case Hughes Tool Co. II, which created unions' duty of fair representation. He also wrote a dissent, affirmed by the courts, holding that it was illegal sex discrimination for unions to have a waiters' union and a separate waitresses' union.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Wayne N. Aspinall was born in Middleburg, Ohio on April 3, 1896. He was the oldest child of Mack Aspinall and Jessie Edna Norviel Aspinall. The family moved to Colorado in 1904 in order to improve the health of Aspinall’s mother. They located in Palisade, Colorado, where his father became a fruit grower. Aspinall was educated at Mt. Lincoln Public School in Palisade. His college education at the University of Denver (DU) was interrupted by World War I, in which he served in the air service of the Signal Corps as a corporal and staff sergeant. After the armistice, he returned to the University of Denver and received a Bachelors of Arts degree in 1919. After college he returned to Palisade where he taught, served on the school board and helped operate the family orchard for several years before returning to DU and earning a law degree in 1925. 

Aspinall passed the Colorado Bar in 1925, returned to the Western Slope, and opened a law practice. In addition to his law practice and a continued interest in the family orchard, Aspinall was a member of the Board of Trustees of the Town of Palisade from 1926-1934. He was elected to the Colorado House of Representatives in 1931 and served as Democratic Party Whip in 1931 and 1933 and as Speaker in 1937 and 1938. He advanced to the Colorado Senate in 1939, serving as Democratic Whip in 1939, Majority Floor Leader in 1941 and Minority Floor Leader in 1943, 1945 and 1947. __During World War II, Aspinall served as a captain in the Military Government as a legal expert, and participated in the Normandy drive as an American officer assigned to the English Second Army. In 1948 he was elected to the United States House of Representatives, where he served until 1972. His tenure in the House was devoted to representing his district especially in areas of natural resources and water issues. He was Chairman of the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, and ex officio member of Subcommittees on Territorial and Insular Affairs, Irrigation and Reclamation, Public Lands, Indian Affairs, Mines and Mining, and National Parks. He was a member of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Raw Materials. He was also a member of the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct and Chairman of the Public Land Law Review Committee. He wrote or sponsored crucial legislation on the development of water resources in Colorado and the West.

Aspinall lost his bid for reelection in 1972, a defeat he believed was due to the redistricting accomplished by the Republican dominated Colorado Legislature. He returned to Palisade and joined his son, Owen, in the law firm of Aspinall and Aspinall. He also served as a consultant to several companies involved in natural resources. 

Aspinall married Julia Edith Kuns of Lincoln, Nebraska, on January 27, 1920. They had four children, Wayne Norviel II, Owen Stewart, Richard Daniel, and Ruth JoAnne Flora. Julia Aspinall died in 1969. In 1970, Aspinall married Essie Jeffers Best of Grand Junction, whom he had known since 1910 and dated in high school. She died on August 5, 1983, just months before Aspinall’s own death on October 9, 1983 at the age of 87. He was survived by three of his four children, Owen Stewart, Richard Daniel and Ruth JoAnne Flora. 

Aspinall was a member of Beta Theta Pi, legal fraternity Phi Delta Phi, and honorary biology fraternity of Phi Sigma. He was a member of Blue Lodge Masonic Fraternity, Scottish Rite 33°, Knights Templar, A.A.O.N.M.S., International Order of Odd Fellows, American Legion, Forty and Eight, Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Elks, Lions International, Order of the Moose, and the Mesa and Colorado Bar Associations. He received honorary degrees from the University of Alaska in 1962, the University of Denver in 1963, Colorado State University in 1963, and the Colorado School of Mines in 1965. He was recipient of many honors, including the 1965 ''Outstanding Citizen of the Year'' from Palisade Chamber of Commerce, and Club 20’s ''Man of the Year'' in 1979 for his work on water and energy projects. He was named the man who had done most to support the mining industry in the United States by the American Institute of Mining, Petroleum and Metallurgical Engineers in 1977.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Herbert Alonzo Howe was born November 22, 1858 in Brockport, New York, the son of Alonzo J. Howe and Julia M. Osgood. Herbert A. Howe graduated from the University of Chicago at the age of 16 and received his master's degree from the University of Cincinnati. While at the University of Cincinnati, he was an assistant in the Cincinnati Observatory. He also held a Doctor of Science Degree from Boston and LL.Ds from two other schools. Herbert Howe married Fannie Shattuck in 1884 and the couple had four sons. Fannie was the daughter of Joseph Shattuck, Professor of Pedagogy at the University of Denver, Denver. Colorado. __Herbert Alonzo Howe came to the University of Denver in 1880 with Chancellor David H. Moore. In 1888, Humphrey Barker Chamberlin offered to finance the building of an observatory for the University. During the next six years, Howe oversaw the building of the Chamberlin Observatory. He picked the location that was far from the smoke and lights of the City of Denver. Chamberlin was financially ruined in the panic of 1893 before the telescope was purchased. Howe made design changes to the telescope to lower the price to $3,000 and then personally borrowed the $3,000 needed even though his salary was only $2,000 a year. Howe went to the manufacturer George Saegmuller in Washington, D.C. to learn how to install the telescope and then took a three week train ride to bring the telescope to the University. Howe oversaw the installation of the telescope and the opening of the Chamberlin Observatory in 1894.  

Herbert Howe was at the University of Denver for 46 years. During those years he earned a reputation as an internationally known astronomer and mathematician. He held numerous positions at the University, including Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences and Director of the Chamberlin Observatory.  He was Professor of Astronomy and Applied Mathematics before there was an observatory. Without his dedication, the Chamberlin Observatory could not have been built. Herbert Howe died in 1926.</Bio_Org_History>

Howe went to the manufacturer George Saegmuller in Washington, D.C. to learn how to install the telescope and then took a three week train ride to bring the telescope to the University. Howe oversaw the installation of the telescope and the opening of the Chamberlin Observatory in 1894.  

Herbert Howe was at the University of Denver for 46 years. During those years he earned a reputation as an internationally known astronomer and mathematician. He held numerous positions at the University, including Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences and Director of the Chamberlin Observatory.  He was Professor of Astronomy and Applied Mathematics before there was an observatory. Without his dedication, the Chamberlin Observatory could not have been built. Herbert Howe died in 1926.</Bio_Org_History_Bio._Expansion>

      <Bio_Org_History>Archie Loyd Threlkeld, known as A. L., was born in Missouri in 1889. He was educated at Northeast Missouri State Teacher's College, University of Chicago, University of Wisconsin, and University of Missouri. His honorary degrees included a Doctor of Laws from the University of Denver and a Doctor of Education from the University of Colorado. 
Threlkeld was Superintendent of Schools in Chillicothe, Missouri and in 1921 he was president of the Missouri State Teachers' Association. He came to Denver, Colorado in 1921 as Assistant Superintendent under Jesse H. Newlon. In 1924 he was named Deputy Superintendent, and in 1927 became Superintendent of the Denver Public Schools. He was President of the American Association of School Administrations in 1936 and1937. Threlkeld left Denver in 1937 to become Superintendent of Schools in Montclair, New Jersey. During World War II he took a leave of absence to direct the High School Victory Corps in the Federal Office of Education. He was on the faculty at the Teachers College at Columbia University from 1950 to 1952 and at Harvard Graduate School during the 1952 school year. 
A. L. Threlkeld held a democratic philosophy of education and insisted on teacher participation in curriculum building and in developing administrative policies. He believed that all children, regardless of economic conditions, deserved the best possible education. The collection demonstrates the struggle to maintain educational quality during the Depression.
Threlkeld's first wife, Anna, died after they moved to Denver. He married his second wife Mary Miller in 1925. When he died in 1967, he was survived by his wife, sons Aubrey M. and Richard A., and daughter Ellen H. Threlkeld.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>William E. Barrett was born November 16, 1900 in New York City, the son of John Joseph and Eleanor Margaret (Flannery). He attended Manhatten College in New York and worked as the Rocky Mountain advertising manager for Westinghouse from 1923-1929. In 1929 he became a free-lance writer (although he had published his first poem at age 15). 

Barrett married Christine M. Rollman on February 15, 1925; they had two children, William E., Jr. and Marjorie Christine. 

Barrett was an amateur pilot, a member of the National Press Club, the Denver Press Club, P.E.N., Colorado Authors League (of which he was president 1943-1944), Denver Athletic Club, and the Sierra Club. He received a citation from Regis College in 1956, and an Honorary Doctor of Literature degree from Creighton University in 1961. 

William E. Barrett wrote the following published books: Woman on Horseback (biography), 1938; Flight From Youth, 1939; Aviation as a Business, 1945; The Evil Heart, 1946; The Number of My Days, 1947; To the Last Man, 1948; The Left Hand of God, 1951; The Shadows of the Images, 1953; The Sudden Strangers, 1956; The Empty Shrine, 1958; The First War Planes, 1960; The Edge of Things (collection of two novellas and two novels), 1960; The Lilies of the Field, 1962; The Fools of Time, 1963; The Shepherd of Mankind, 1964; The Glory Tent, 1967; The Red Lacquered Gate, 1967; The Wine and the Music (also under the title Pieces of Dreams), 1968; A Woman in the House, 1971; The Shape of Illusion, 1972; and Lady of the Lotus, 1975. 

Barrett also wrote short stories which appeared in seventeen collections and anthologies and were published in many national magazines. His novel The Left Hand of God was translated into 10 different languages, while his other novels have been translated into an average of 5 different languages. Four of Barrett's books were purchased for films: The Left Hand of God (starring Humphrey Bogart), produced in 1955; The Lilies of the Field (starring Sidney Poitier), produced in 1963; The Wine and the Music, which was produced as Pieces of Dreams (starring Robert Forster and Lauren Hutton), produced in 1970; and The Man From Rome, which was purchased but never produced. 

Barrett moved to Denver, Colorado with his family at the age of 16, and resided there for many years. He passed away at his family home in Denver in 1986, at the age of 85.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Professor of Anthropology Etienne B. Renaud (1880-1973) began working as a lecturer in Anthropology at the University of Denver in 1920 and remained a faculty member until his retirement in 1948. He was the first professional archaeologist to make a systematic study of eastern Colorado. In the summer of 1929, Renaud directed a field expedition for the Colorado Museum of Natural History (now the Denver Museum of Nature and Science). He then proceeded with other archaeological surveys of the western High Plains. His archaeology reports were supported not only by the University of Denver, but also by the Smithsonian Institution. After his retirement, he continued to travel, write papers, and give lectures.  The collection reflects Renaud's influence on  archaeological survey methods, showing one of the first attempts at systematic excavations ever made in the western High Plains. Renaud was instrumental in the development of the Anthropology Department at the University of Denver, becoming its first full professor in 1924. When the Mary Reed Building was built in 1932, Renaud designed the space for the Museum of Anthropology. Many of the artifacts collected during Renaud's archaeological fieldwork are part of the museum's collection. Renaud was a forerunner in the field of archaeology in the Rocky Mountain Region, and contributed greatly to the field as a whole. He influenced many students and colleagues, writing approximately 125 articles for American and European publications on archaeology, craniometry, linguistics, and Native American religion.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Levette J. Davidson was born in Eureka, Illinois May 16, 1894, one of four children. Because his grand uncle was past-President of Eureka College, a Christian seminary, Davidson was ''reared in the school's shadow'' with the option of becoming ''either a teacher or a preacher.'' He chose teaching and was awarded his B.A. from Eureka in 1915. A year later he received his A.M. degree from the University of Illinois where he received Phi Beta Kappa honors. In 1917 he earned his M.A. in social science and history at Harvard University. __During World War I, he served with the Tenth Infantry of the Forty-Sixth Division and also served as an army sergeant in Intelligence. Davidson and his wife Mary, also a graduate of Eureka, were married in 1918. At the end of the war, Davidson simultaneously taught and studied at the University of Michigan where he earned a Ph.D. in languages and literatures in 1922. He arrived in Denver later that year and began teaching at the University of Denver. Before arriving in Colorado, his academic specialty was eighteenth century England. Once in Denver, he realized that Western literature and folklore would be his life work. Davidson taught at the University of Denver until his death in 1957. His course topics ranged from studies of Shakespeare and other English literature, to folklore in the West. He began teaching news writing and eventually founded the journalism department at the University as well as the board of publications and the press club. He was the first faculty member elected to serve as president of the University Senate. In 1940 he became head of the English Department and from March to August 1953 he served as interim Chancellor. At the time of assuming his post, he remarked: ''There is hardly an organization on campus that I have not been connected with at one time or another.''  Davidson was named University Lecturer for 1956. He was also a nationally acclaimed expert in folklore, especially that of Colorado and the West. Davidson was a director of the Colorado State Historical Society, the Modern Languages Association, the American Folklore Society, and the American Dialect Society. He was a charter member of the Denver Posse of the Westerners, an organization devoted to western folklore. In spare moments, Davidson conducted research, wrote outlines for plays, and authored a large number of articles. He contributed to a wide range of magazines from Western American to Shakespeare Quarterly. Additionally,  Davidson authored several books on folklore. The most widely recognized is Rocky Mountain Tales, which presents regional folklore as well as true accounts of early events in the area. Levette Davidson died May 14, 1957.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Ira E. Cutler was born in Putnam, Connecticut on October 8, 1863. In 1893, he graduated from Albion College in Michigan with a Bachelor of Sciences degree. In 1907, he received his Master of Arts degree from the University of Denver and in 1919 Albion College granted him an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. Ira Cutler married Amelia Perkins of Michigan on August 1, 1894. From 1924 to 1928, he served as national president of the Phi Sigma Society, an honorary biology fraternity. __In 1898, Cutler joined the faculty of the University of Denver as Professor of Biology and Zoology. In his later years he was noted for his work in the field of ornithology, gathering an assortment of bird species that forms the nucleus of the University’s ornithological collection. He did not limit himself to this field, however. From one of the largest pharmaceutical and botanical gardens in the West, located just north of Warren Avenue on University Boulevard, he supplied multiple botanical retailers and developed new varieties of columbines (including a now lost spurless variety), iris, cacti, and other plants. Producers of digitalis obtained monkshood from this garden. He was both a pioneer and an authority on raising grapes in Colorado. Additionally, he developed hybrids of Indian corn in an experimental plot at the corner of South Josephine and Evans Avenue while working as a government expert from 1916-1920. While visiting the Western Slope, Chancellor Henry Buchtel was given an unusual rose bush. The flowers’ coloring—red centers with yellow petals—coincided with the University’s colors. The Chancellor gave the bush to Cutler who made cuttings of it to plant on the University of Denver campus. After much research, Cutler discovered that the bush, known locally as the ''Denver University Rose'', is more commonly known as the Austrian Copper. Besides studying plants, Cutler investigated the genetics of creepers, a type of fowl, and also studied milk goats. He corresponded with several organizations dedicated to genetics and eugenics. Cutler conducted extensive geological research in the Florissant District of Colorado and taught courses in geology at the University. 

In addition to academic interests, Cutler also enjoyed artistic and community oriented pursuits. He formed a boys club that was to become the first Boy Scout troop west of the Mississippi. During World War I, Cutler turned from professor to commander, becoming staff captain to train the students of the University of Denver’s R.O.T.C. He organized the University of Denver Glee Club in 1900 and directed it for many years, helping the members to successfully tour several surrounding states. He directed the choir at University Park Methodist Episcopal Church, which is located across University Boulevard from the University Park campus. He supervised the publication of the first edition of a book entitled, the Denver University College Songs, which contained several of his own compositions. He wrote the University of Denver alma mater, ''Hail to Denver U.'' Chancellor David Shaw Duncan claimed that Cutler’s paintings ''revealed an artist of merit.'' Cutler utilized this artistic ability in arranging floral decorations for University functions. 

In 1934, Professor Cutler was granted retirement as Professor Emeritus. He died May 25, 1936. The Cutler influence at the University of Denver did not end, however. His daughter Marjorie, who attended the University in the 1920s, became the registrar in 1937 in which capacity she served the University until 1970. She died September 1, 1990.

      <Bio_Org_History>Fallis Rees is quoted in a May 1969 article in the Rocky Mountain News as saying that if he had known about archeology as a young man, he would have been an archaeologist even if it meant starving. In fact, he waited until his retirement to indulge in his passion for archeology. 

Fallis F. Rees was born in Cincinnati, Ohio on April 19, 1897. He attended Cincinnati public schools and the University of Cincinnati. In 1917 he married Elizabeth Beechgood. They had two children, a son, F. Worth, and a daughter, Katherine. It is not known when he moved to Colorado, but he founded Brick, Inc. in 1932 after working as a sales manager for Denver Pressed Brick Co. He retired in 1962 and began acquiring Indian pottery. His interest soon expanded to ancient artifacts. Those artifacts led to his studying archeology. He became convinced that the similarities between Egyptian art and religion and that of the Mayans and other peoples of ancient America were due to cross-Atlantic contact during the height of Egyptian cultural dominance. In addition to collecting artifacts and art, he began corresponding with archaeologists around the world who were working in areas that complemented Rees' theory. One outcome of his interest was that he completed a manuscript about his research and his theories of cultural contacts in the ancient world. The last years of his life were spent trying to find a publisher for his manuscript, and continuing his artifact collection, which he housed in his Ko-Kas-Ki Museum in Pinedale, Colorado, before transferring it to the University of Denver. His wife helped in the museum as well as accompanying him on his research expeditions to Mexico and South America. 

Rees was a member of the Board of Directors of First Federal Savings and Loan Association, a past Grand Chancellor of Colorado Knights of Pythias, past imperial prince of the Dramatic Order of Knights of Khorassan, a member of the Black Hawk Masonic Lodge No. 16, and a member of the Colorado and New Mexico Archaeological Societies. He died February 19, 1980, survived by his wife, son, daughter, five grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The Denver Women's Social Union Club, a club for poor and working-class women, was founded as a mutual-aid society in November 1898 by members of the Social Science Department of the Women's Club of Denver. The club was established to benefit women and their families living in the Delgany neighborhood. The Social Science Department of the Women's Club of Denver ran a variety of social programs in the Delgany neighborhood ranging from a night school and Traveling Art Gallery to free baths. The Delgany Library was housed in the Railroad Mission at 19th Street and Wewatta Street and it was here that the initial meeting of the Social Union was held during which women resolved to form an organization to meet the needs of the people in the area. Mary C.C. Bradford, a member of the Women's Club of Denver, was later considered the mother of the Social Union because of her help in its early years. She christened the mutual-aid organization 'The Social Union,' a name that was retained until 1921 when it was reorganized as a philanthropic and social organization and renamed 'The Denver Women's Social Union Club.' The Penny Provident Fund, established for members of the Social Union, became the Social Union Savings Bank in 1903 in which club members deposited what savings they could. This money was used as an emergency fund to aid needy members in hard times. Mary C.C. Bradford described the benefits of the Social Union to its members: ''The uplift that the meetings have given to these toil-worn, shut-in lives is incalculable. Vistas of beauty have been opened, stronger thinking stimulated, home problems solved, and best of all, the sense of loving unity established between themselves and their more fortunate sisters.'' (from Some Work of the WCD in A History of the Women's Club of Denver by Mary Sinton) __Meetings generally consisted of business followed by refreshments and a program. During the meeting, women would suggest those in need whom the organization might assist in one way or another and plan benefits such as cake baking contests or raffles. The money thus earned would go to fund the Union's activities. For example, during 1908-1909, the women of the Social Union made visits to homes and hospitals and delivered bouquets, jellies, fruits, bundles of clothing, a total of eight tons of coal, and 14 dollars to the sick and needy. ''We also have endeavored to answer every call of sickness and distress that has come to us, as well as to visit every member of the S.U. who has been ill.'' (from Minutes 1908-1916) The programs were organized by individual members and included a variety of presentations. For example, one meeting on March 29, 1923 included a talk by Mary C.C. Bradford, who gave an ''account of [the] compulsory educational bill and urged women to sign it,'' followed by a program of ''fancy dancing'' presented by Virginia Jardt and Janice Goalstone. (from Minutes 1923-1924) 

The last meeting of the Denver Women's Social Union Club was held in 1973 and the remaining 25 members decided to close the books on November 4, 1977 ''due to [the fact that] many of our faithful members passed on.'' (from Minutes 1957-1973).</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Benjamin Poff Draper was born on July 10, 1907, in Hot Springs County, Arkansas.  After his mother, Lillian Poff Draper, died in 1914, Benjamin Draper and his father, William Eliot Draper, moved to Denver, Colorado. Benjamin Draper attended Hyde Park School and the Manual Training High School in Denver. He graduated from the University of Denver in 1928 with a B.A. in speech and drama. In 1936, he received his Master's in English literature from the same institution. Benjamin Draper earned a Ph.D. in economics from Chicago University and a Ph.D. in theater from the University of Denver in 1969.

According to information in the Western History Department at Denver Public Library, Draper and his sister performed with the Child Players as extras in Robert B. Mantel's production of Julius Caesar at the Broadway Theatre in Denver. From 1929-1936,  Draper held the position of stage manager at the University Civic Theatre, which later became the Bonfils Theatre. He was also an assistant to Ida Kruse McFarlane and Anne Evans at the Central City Festival in the 1930s. 

Draper’s connection to the mountain towns of Colorado continued and in 1946, he ran for State Representative for Clear Creek, Eagle, Gilpin, Summit and Pitkin Counties. In 1947, he met and married Barbara McCracken. In 1948, he received an appointment as Director of the Colorado Resources Development Council and he was President of Georgetown Enterprises, Inc., an organization formed for the purpose of restoration of the mining town. 

Draper left Colorado for California in 1949, where he worked in the broadcast industries and where he won an Emmy for his series, “Science in Action.”  In 1958, Benjamin Draper won the Westinghouse History Award for his television show about Sir Francis Drake. His interest in Drake led him to become a member of the Drake Navigators Guild and in 1959, he won the Browning Society Award for his dramatic monologue on Sir Francis Drake. Benjamin Draper spent 20 years compiling a bibliography on Drake's voyage. In conjunction with Assemblyman William Bagley, Senator Peter Behr and the California Governor's office, he was progenitor of the bill that created the Sir Francis Drake Commission. 

He was a professor of broadcast communications at San Francisco State College.  During his tenure there, he returned to Denver to complete a Ph.D. in theatre at the University of Denver.  During that time he was active in helping to develop a collection of theatre historical materials.

      <Bio_Org_History>Caleb Frank Gates (1903-1955), born in Constantinople (now Istanbul), received his early education at Roberts College in Istanbul. His father served as President of the Institution. Gates came to the United States in 1919 and attended the Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania for three years. In 1926, he graduated with honors from Princeton University and continued his studies under a Rhodes scholarship at Balliol College in Oxford. In 1928, while attending college, Gates married Elizabeth Farnum in England. They raised four children: Caleb Jr., Betsy Ann, Mary Ellen, and Gwynne.

      <Bio_Org_History>Benjamin Poff Draper was born on July 10, 1907, in Hot Springs County, Arkansas.  After his mother, Lillian Poff Draper, died in 1914, Benjamin Draper and his father, William Eliot Draper, moved to Denver, Colorado. Benjamin Draper attended Hyde Park School and the Manual Training High School in Denver. He graduated from the University of Denver in 1928 with a B.A. in speech and drama. In 1936, he received his Master's in English literature from the same institution. Benjamin Draper earned a Ph.D. in economics from Chicago University and a Ph.D. in theater from the University of Denver in 1969.

According to information in the Western History Department at Denver Public Library, Draper and his sister performed with the Child Players as extras in Robert B. Mantel's production of Julius Caesar at the Broadway Theatre in Denver. From 1929-1936,  Draper held the position of stage manager at the University Civic Theatre, which later became the Bonfils Theatre. He was also an assistant to Ida Kruse McFarlane and Anne Evans at the Central City Festival in the 1930s. 

Draper’s connection to the mountain towns of Colorado continued and in 1946, he ran for State Representative for Clear Creek, Eagle, Gilpin, Summit and Pitkin Counties. In 1947, he met and married Barbara McCracken. In 1948, he received an appointment as Director of the Colorado Resources Development Council and he was President of Georgetown Enterprises, Inc., an organization formed for the purpose of restoration of the mining town. 

Draper left Colorado for California in 1949, where he worked in the broadcast industries and where he won an Emmy for his series, “Science in Action.”  In 1958, Benjamin Draper won the Westinghouse History Award for his television show about Sir Francis Drake. His interest in Drake led him to become a member of the Drake Navigators Guild and in 1959, he won the Browning Society Award for his dramatic monologue on Sir Francis Drake. Benjamin Draper spent 20 years compiling a bibliography on Drake's voyage. In conjunction with Assemblyman William Bagley, Senator Peter Behr and the California Governor's office, he was progenitor of the bill that created the Sir Francis Drake Commission. 

He was a professor of broadcast communications at San Francisco State College.  During his tenure there, he returned to Denver to complete a Ph.D. in theatre at the University of Denver.  During that time he was active in helping to develop a collection of theatre historical materials.  

Benjamin Poff Draper died on July 10, 1980.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Deatt Hudson was born June 20, 1931 at Presbyterian Hospital in Denver, Colorado to Margaret McEwan Hudson and George Fletcher Hudson. The family moved to Georgetown and Longmont before settling in Dolores, Colorado.  In an autobiography she wrote as a school assignment she said that although the bars in town outnumbered the stores 2 to 1, she found the people ''good-hearted and friendly.''  Even at this early age, she wanted to write poetry and short stories, although she admitted that teaching would probably be a better choice if she wanted to eat.  

Her parents had high expectations for their daughter, and yet allowed her to make her own decisions. She believed that this helped her become self-reliant and taught her to form her own opinions. She loved to travel, and a year-long trip to Peru in 1962-1963 had a great deal of influence on both her writing and teaching styles. Deatt Hudson never married and was an only child, so at the time of her death her friends and her students were her family. 

Deatt Hudson received her first literary award during her junior year of high school, when she won first place in a Western State College scholarship contest in American literature. Hudson attended Dolores High School and graduated valedictorian in 1948. She was awarded a scholarship to any of the state schools, but opted to earn her B.A. at the University of Denver where she was elected Phi Beta Kappa. She also participated in Ballroom Partners, a dance group. She received an M.A. in American Studies from Yale University in 1954 and another in English from the Breadloaf School of English at Middlebury College in 1967.

Upon receiving her first M.A., she began teaching at North High School in Denver.  After some time at North High School, she began teaching English at Colorado Women’s College. After retiring from her position, she continued to teach at Emily Griffith Opportunity School where she taught English as a Second Language. Those who knew her all agreed that she was an outstanding teacher, who believed that teaching was the noblest profession.

Throughout her life, Hudson wrote poetry and short stories, which were published in The New Yorker, The Nation, Prism and other periodicals. 

Towards the end of her life, Deatt Hudson suffered greatly from asthma, which significantly curtailed her activities. She died of respiratory arrest November 19, 1988 at the age of 57.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The Women's Library Association, ''dedicated to the premise that a great university must have as its heart a great library,'' was established in 1956 as the Women's Committee of the University of Denver. At the request of Chancellor Chester Alter, Marion Gottesfeld (Hurwitz) and Peg Bradford, both University trustees, formed a committee to raise funds for the University's libraries and to acquire book donations and manuscript collections to support University research and teaching. This committee, composed of seven other members, including Mrs. Harry Bellamy, Mrs. Horace Bennett, Mrs. David Chalmers, Mrs. Dayton Denious, Mrs. William Iliff, Mrs. Sam Levy, and Mrs. Harold Webster (Frances), organized an initial campaign that resulted in significant contributions to the Mary Reed Library. 

In 1958, the Women's Committee of the University of Denver became the Women's Committee for the Library, also known as the Women's Library Committee. Under the leadership of Marion Gottesfeld (Hurwitz) the activities of the group were expanded, and the organization set out to build the library's collections through the solicitation of donations from organized women's groups and individuals, and the creation of a memorial book program. The new committee's enthusiasm and commitment was summed up in a 1959 Denver Post article, in which Marion Gottesfeld, referring to the Mary Reed Library, stated that, ''a woman built this library so it's up to the women of the community to keep it up.''

By 1965 the Women's Library Committee had grown to over 130 members and their impact was strongly felt, as they were responsible for acquiring seventy percent of the gifts made to the University of Denver libraries from 1964-1965. To reward this dedicated work a new organization was formed in December 1965 by proclamation of University Chancellor Dr. Chester M. Alter. The Women's Library Committee was renamed the Women's Library Association, with its own bylaws and Executive Board. Marion Gottesfeld (Hurwitz) was named the first Executive Chair, with Janet Pirkey appointed as the general chair of the Annual Support program. The new organization was designed to involve a greater number of women from the Denver community. They hoped to reach this goal with the Annual Support program, which recruited women to become Sustaining, Associate, and Contributing members of the WLA. Members were eligible to attend a series of educational lectures, which became the WLA Lecture Series, presented by University faculty and community leaders. 

In the 1970s and 1980s the organization developed several creative events. Some of the most notable include the annual Art and Antique auction, the Bargain Bazaar garage sale, the WLA cookbook A Stirring Experience, Mansions in Miniature (a miniature collectible show and sale), the Craftskeller gift shop (a store for students in the student union), and the annual spring book sale. Along with providing funding for books and manuscript collections, the work of the Women's Library Association also reached more widely into campus affairs. They had a representative on the committee to select the architect for Penrose Library, which opened in 1972. In addition, they sponsored many special events on campus, including a reception in 1964 for U Thant, Secretary General of the United Nations, and an exhibit in Penrose library of the University's collection of prints by photographer Edward S. Curtis in 1975. 

Today, the Women's Library Association remains an important source of support for the University of Denver Libraries. Their used bookstore, The Book Stack, comprises the majority of their efforts for the libraries, along with the WLA Lecture Series, the Living Library Fund, and the contributions of annual members.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Born in New York City on Feb. 9, 1915, Maurice Mitchell attended New York University and began his career in advertising working for the New York Times in 1935.  He also served as advertising director and managing editor of the Gouverneur Tribune Press (NY). From that position, he continued working as advertising director for three upstate New York daily papers. After his service with the Army Tank Corps in World War II, Mitchell’s interest in communications turned to the electronic field. Mitchell joined the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) as manager of the Washington, D.C. Station, WTOP. In 1948, he assumed an executive position with the National Association of Broadcasters and in 1950 joined the Muzak Corporation as vice-president. His success in that post led to his selection as President of Encyclopedia Britannica Films, Inc., in 1962. Through his job at the National Association of Broadcasters, Mitchell taught several summer seminars (1948-1950) in broadcasting and communications management at the University of Denver in Denver, Colorado. He resigned in 1967 to become Chancellor of the University of Denver. __Maurice Mitchell was inaugurated Chancellor of the University of Denver on October 20, 1967. He served as the thirteenth Chancellor of the University of Denver from 1967 to 1978. He brought experience in business, education, and national affairs to the post. He served as Chancellor for eleven years, leaving in 1978 to become President of the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, located in California. During his tenure at the University of Denver a host of new programs began, such as the annual Publishing Institute. Gifts also made several new buildings possible. The buildings constructed under his leadership include Penrose Library and the Shwayder Art Building. A noteworthy incident that occurred during his tenure was Woodstock West, a student protest against the Vietnam War. Due to his firm resolve, peace returned to campus and classes continued during the height of student protests across the United States.
He then left to work as President of the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions. Mitchell resigned from the Center when it merged with the University of California. In 1983, he became President of the Washington program at the Annenberg School of Communications. Mitchell served on the boards of many professional corporations and civic organizations including Colorado and Southern Railroad, the Federal Reserve Bank (Denver Branch), the Colorado State Historical Society, the United States Commission on Civil Rights, and the Colorado Springs Saving Bonds Committee. He received numerous awards for his hard work and dedication, including the Brotherhood Award, National Conference of Christians and Jews (1968); the George Washington Medal, Freedoms Foundation of Valley Forge (1969); the Service to Mankind Award, Mile High Sertoma Club (1970); the Golden Plate Award, American Academy of Achievement (1972); and the Malcolm Glenn Wyer Award of the Adult Education Council of Metropolitan Denver (1975). He married Mary V. Rowles in 1951. They had three children, Lee, Keith, and Deborah. Mrs. Mitchell was active in the University of Denver Women’s Association, the Kent School for Girls, and several other organizations. She passed away in 1991. Maurice Mitchell died in 1996.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Gertrude G. Dienst (1887-  ), daughter of Theodore Grabowsky of Ratibor, Germany, and Julia di Bernell of Manheim Baden, Germany, was born April 5, 1887 in the Bismarck Hotel in Chicago, en route to Denver, Colorado. She and her brother were raised by their father, a miner in Silverton, Colorado, and stepmother. Her education began in the two-room 29th Street School. Dienst continued her elementary education at the Gilpin School and the Boulevard School before attending North Denver High School. She graduated in 1907 and was sent to the University in Breslau, Germany. Due to financial constraints, she left the University and worked as an English governess until her marriage to George Dienst at the American Consulate in 1911. She enjoyed working at the Joslin's department store between 1912 and 1940, first as a sales clerk, then as an assistant buyer. During World War I, she was responsible for the Red Cross Relief Collections to benefit warhorses and dogs. She also taught salesmanship classes and applied psychology at an opportunity school for soldiers returning from the war. 

On January 20, 1942, under the leadership of Gertrude Dienst, 25 women organized a women's auxiliary Red Cross unit in Denver to help with World War II relief efforts. Officially titled ''The American Red Cross Production Unit and War Service of the Denver Turner's Auxiliary for the Denver Federation of Federated Women's Clubs,'' the group immediately began work collecting donations, as well as sewing and knitting for the needy in Europe, both soldier and civilian. After the war, this same group of women continued to help the German people by forming a Colorado branch of the American Committee for the Relief of German Needy. All told, this group of women sent more than three tons of relief packages overseas through August 1951.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Arrang_Organiz>This collection is arranged as it was received from Mrs. Korbel.  It is organized into five series:;  1.  Personal correspondence, 1940-1967.;  2.  Research and Manuscripts on Kashmir and Czechoslovakia, 1919-1964.;  3.  Years at Oxford.  1961-1964.;  4.  Speaking Engagements, 1959-1967.;  5.

      <Bio_Org_History>Dr. Josef Korbel followed a unique path towards his long association with the University of Denver (DU). Born in Czechoslovakia on September 20, 1909, he studied at the Sorbonne in Paris before receiving a Doctor of Law Degree from Charles University, Prague in 1933, with emphasis on international relations. He began his diplomatic career with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Prague in 1934. In 1937 he was appointed Press and Cultural Attaché of the Czechoslovak Legation in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. __After the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, he escaped with his family to London, where he joined the Czechoslovak government in exile. He served as personal secretary to Jan Masaryk until 1940 when he became head of the broadcasting department. 

After the war, Korbel returned to Czechoslovakia, where he served as Chef de Cabinet to Masaryk, and helped organize the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Prague. He also served on the Czechoslovak delegation to the Paris Peace Conference. His next appointment was as Ambassador to Yugoslavia. That appointment ended with the take over of the Czechoslovak government by the communists. The Korbels were forced to leave Czechoslovakia once again, and made their way to New York City. Korbel had been appointed by the Czechoslovak government to a United Nations Commission on India and Pakistan. The staff of the United Nations persuaded Korbel to continue to serve the Commission as long as possible, which he did. He served as chairman and delivered the first commission report to the U.N. Security Council before pressure from the government in Prague forced his retirement from the Commission in 1949.

A connection to the United Nations brought Josef Korbel to the United States and then to Denver and the University. It was at that point that Korbel began his career at the University of Denver, being named Professor in International Relations and a staff member of the Social Sciences Foundation. In 1959 he was appointed Dean of the Graduate School of International Studies and Director of the Social Science Foundation, thereby adding his leadership to one of the outstanding programs in world affairs. He then served as Dean of the Graduate School of International Studies and Director of the Social Science Foundation, and was named the first Andrew W. Mellon Professor of International Studies in 1969. His tenure at DU was marked by an active teaching and writing schedule, which included mentoring such students as his daughter, Madeline Albright, and Condoleezza Rice. During his years at DU, Korbel also served as visiting professor at such institutions as MIT, Harvard, Columbia, and Oxford. According to his own assessment, Korbel was fluent in four languages, good in two more and had a good reading knowledge of an additional two. That grasp of languages aided him in his research, which led to six books and numerous articles, dealing primarily with Eastern Europe and Cold War diplomacy. 

In addition to his international reputation, Korbel is remembered at the University of Denver as an outstanding teacher and scholar. His students remember a caring teacher who was generous with his time. His colleagues remembered him as nurturing and supportive. All who knew him at the University of Denver remembered him as a person who enjoyed good food and good company and loved good conversation, especially over the dinner table. He looked forward to the future with the experience of his past, but was never bitter about what had happened to him and his family. When he died of cancer in 1977, he was honored by his colleagues and students in a special ceremony, and by the University with the establishment of the Josef Korbel Memorial Scholarship.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Lilian White Spencer was born in 1876 in Albany, New York. She was the fifth of nine children of Frederick W. and Catherine (McGurk) White. At the time of her birth, Spencer's father was a writer for and part owner of the Albany Union. He had entered the field of journalism shortly after his marriage and during the early years of his career wrote for the New York Sun and edited the Albany Express. Eventually the family left New York and moved to Denver. Frederick White became famous in the West and throughout the country as an editorial writer, critic, and essayist for the Denver Post, under the initials ''F.W.W.''

Spencer followed her father into journalism after attending a series of French convent schools from which she graduated at age 15. She worked briefly with him at the Denver Post and later held a civic job for a few months before she married George Soule Spencer and left Denver. __During her marriage Spencer lived in New York City. Her husband was an actor, and her writing centered around the theater in the form of play reviews, script revisions, and the writing of plays. A full-length play and several one-act plays were produced. At this time she also wrote movie scenarios, many of which were accepted by the Edison and Vitagraph Companies. 

After the deaths of her parents, Frederick in February 1917 and Catherine in March 1918, and the end of her marriage, Spencer returned to Denver. It was at this time that she made her first attempts at verse. The subjects she wrote about most often were Indian life and Colorado. She used these themes repeatedly in her poetry, pageant writing, prose and public addresses in schools and over the radio. In addition, Spencer was interested in astronomy. She was a member of the Astronomical Society of France and published a textbook for the Nutshell Science series of Chicago called Astronomy Without a Telescope. Some of her best known works were her translations of French poems of which more than 50 were published, many of which won awards. 

Spencer was best known in the Denver area as a writer of pageants. ''Hymn to Colorado'' (music by Mrs. Forrest Rutherford) was performed in April 1926 by 6,000 Denver school children. In June of the same year her ''Indian Prologue'' (music by Henry Sachs) was presented at the University of Denver. ''The Pageant of Colorado'' (music by Charles Wakefield Cadman), was presented in Denver in May 1927 with a cast of 1500, and was said to have been the largest indoor spectacle ever produced in the West. It was part of a celebration honoring the opening of the Moffat Tunnel. Finally, the ''Pageant of York'' (music by Urban Hershey), was presented in October 1927 in York, Pennsylvania. This pageant used a cast of 5000 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Continental Congress in York. The pageant was published in book form by the city of York and later by Dodd-Mead in their National Pageant Series (October 1929). 

A story in Spencer's poem ''Blue Feather'' inspired a collaboration with Charles Sanford Skilton on the opera The Sun Bride, produced by the National Broadcasting Company on April 17, 1930. The Sun Bride was also presented as a poetic drama at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre near Denver in July 1935 by Marion Parsons Robinson of the University of Denver. 

After 1930, Spencer's efforts turned from writing to getting poems and translations already written published in book form or republished in magazines. In 1944, she and her brother Frank E. White sold the family home at 1490 Stuart Street in Denver and moved to Oceanside, California. It was there that she died on June 23, 1953.</Bio_Org_History>
      <Bio_Org_History_Bio._Expansion>During her marriage Spencer lived in New York City. Her husband was an actor, and her writing centered around the theater in the form of play reviews, script revisions, and the writing of plays. A full-length play and several one-act plays were produced. At this time she also wrote movie scenarios, many of which were accepted by the Edison and Vitagraph Companies. 

After the deaths of her parents, Frederick in February 1917 and Catherine in March 1918, and the end of her marriage, Spencer returned to Denver. It was at this time that she made her first attempts at verse. The subjects she wrote about most often were Indian life and Colorado. She used these themes repeatedly in her poetry, pageant writing, prose and public addresses in schools and over the radio. In addition, Spencer was interested in astronomy. She was a member of the Astronomical Society of France and published a textbook for the Nutshell Science series of Chicago called Astronomy Without a Telescope. Some of her best known works were her translations of French poems of which more than 50 were published, many of which won awards. 

Spencer was best known in the Denver area as a writer of pageants. ''Hymn to Colorado'' (music by Mrs. Forrest Rutherford) was performed in April 1926 by 6,000 Denver school children. In June of the same year her ''Indian Prologue'' (music by Henry Sachs) was presented at the University of Denver. ''The Pageant of Colorado'' (music by Charles Wakefield Cadman), was presented in Denver in May 1927 with a cast of 1500, and was said to have been the largest indoor spectacle ever produced in the West. It was part of a celebration honoring the opening of the Moffat Tunnel. Finally, the ''Pageant of York'' (music by Urban Hershey), was presented in October 1927 in York, Pennsylvania. This pageant used a cast of 5000 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Continental Congress in York. The pageant was published in book form by the city of York and later by Dodd-Mead in their National Pageant Series (October 1929). 

A story in Spencer's poem ''Blue Feather'' inspired a collaboration with Charles Sanford Skilton on the opera The Sun Bride, produced by the National Broadcasting Company on April 17, 1930. The Sun Bride was also presented as a poetic drama at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre near Denver in July 1935 by Marion Parsons Robinson of the University of Denver. 

After 1930, Spencer's efforts turned from writing to getting poems and translations already written published in book form or republished in magazines. In 1944, she and her brother Frank E. White sold the family home at 1490 Stuart Street in Denver and moved to Oceanside, California. It was there that she died on June 23, 1953.</Bio_Org_History_Bio._Expansion>
      <Bio_Org_History_Biograph._History>Lilian White Spencer was born in 1876 in Albany, New York. She was the fifth of nine children of Frederick W. and Catherine (McGurk) White. At the time of her birth, Spencer's father was a writer for and part owner of the Albany Union. He had entered the field of journalism shortly after his marriage and during the early years of his career wrote for the New York Sun and edited the Albany Express. Eventually the family left New York and moved to Denver. Frederick White became famous in the West and throughout the country as an editorial writer, critic, and essayist for the Denver Post, under the initials ''F.W.W.''

Spencer followed her father into journalism after attending a series of French convent schools from which she graduated at age 15. She worked briefly with him at the Denver Post and later held a civic job for a few months before she married George Soule Spencer and left Denver.</Bio_Org_History_Biograph._History>

      <Scope-Content>Lilian White Spencer (1876-1953) was a playwright and poet. Her papers cover the period of her life when she was living and writing in Denver, from 1918 until 1944. The papers include the published copies of many original poems, translations, and pageants, as well as background notes, typescripts, annotated public reading copies, and instructions for publication. Also included are letters from various publishers concerning publication of her work. Of special interest are several matted pen and ink drawings by Dean Babcock that had been used to illustrate Spencer's Bestiary. 

There is very little of a personal nature included in the papers. However, the biography in the collection that was published in 1936 by the Denver Public Library offers some information on the personal history of Lilian White Spencer. It also contains a listing of her published works and the magazines in which they appear. Some personal correspondence as well as other typescripts are available in a similar collection housed in the Western History Department of the Denver Public Library.</Scope-Content>

      <Scope-Content>The materials in this collection document the professional life of R. Russell Porter while he was a member of the faculty of the University of Denver, from 1946 until his retirement in 1976. Administrative materials provide a chronological framework for the artistic works that follow. They include biographies, obituaries, press releases and newspaper clippings, faculty personnel records and evaluations, insurance packages, travel records, brochures, personal papers, interviews, photographs and correspondence. The papers and speeches reflect U.S. society at the time. One paper discusses the assassination of U. S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy, and another the concert at Woodstock, New York. Several concern race relations and the University's responsibility to equal opportunity. Many papers are concerned with the University, and how it could be positioned to successfully educate young people. Several address the current and future state of the American theater. The bulk of the material is composed of artistic works by Porter and others. In some cases, only the finished product is represented. In others, only a program, a press release or piece of correspondence documents the existence of a work. Several drafts of a play (Shale Oil) show the evolution of a particular creation. Early Dawn is particularly well documented, with drafts and correspondence between Porter and Normand Lockwood revealing how a librettist and a composer collaborate to create a work of art.  The collection also includes works by Porter including scholarly articles, speeches, radio scripts, plays, and librettos along with documentation such as playbills, correspondence, publicity photographs, and newspaper clippings. The final segment of the collection includes plays by others to be considered for production at the University of Denver Theatre.</Scope-Content>

Of the Macy family we have little information other than that the family was associated with a firm of Lomax Standly Macy Brokers.  The family also had an ancestor who attended the Naval Academy and served during the Spanish-American War.  

The Chapman family left several narratives of their history, including the fact that Carole's grandfather fought in the Civil War and was later posted to frontier areas before leaving the army and heading west.  Carole's father wrote two accounts of his younger life in Nebraska, California and Colorado.  He describes his parents early years of marriage in Nebraska and a logging camp in California, followed by the births of their children. He continues with his own boyhood memories of living near the logging camp, returning to Nebraska, homesteading in Colorado around the turn of the twentieth century, and finally working, marrying, and raising a family in Colorado.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>John Chapman was born June 25, 1900 in Denver to Arthur and Lillian Mathewson Chapman. Arthur Chapman, a long-time Denver newspaperman, is probably best remembered as the author of ''Out Where the West Begins,'' a poem detailing a sense of the West. John Chapman grew up around the newspaper business, starting a paper route as soon as he was old enough. Beginning in high school he worked as a reporter for the Denver Times, the paper at which his father was employed. He also worked as a shelver at a public library and was one of the Forest Service workers who built roads in Woodland Park. __After graduating from East High School in 1917, his education was irregular. He completed his freshman year at the University of Colorado before spending a year working at the Denver Times. When the family moved to New York, John Chapman entered Columbia (now Columbia University), but never graduated. It wasn't until 1959 that he received an honorary Doctor of Humanities from the University of Denver. On July 31, 1923, John Chapman married Georgia Christina Andrews, also a Denver native. They had one daughter, Karin, who settled in Denver. 

Once in New York, Chapman found a job as a reporter and photographer for the New York Illustrated Daily News. In 1924, the Pacific and Atlantic Photo Bureau, a picture syndicate including the Daily News, sent him to be the Paris manager. Upon returning to New York in 1926, he rejoined the Daily News staff and was mentored by Burns Mantle, a respected theater critic and city editor. Chapman began writing his extremely popular column, ''Mainly About Manhattan,'' which not only provided gossip concerning various city celebrities, but also made Chapman into a celebrity in his own right. He spent two years (1940-1942) in Hollywood, sending newsy and tongue-in-cheek articles back to the Daily News. 

After returning to New York and serving as the night picture editor for a short time, Chapman replaced Burns Mantle as drama critic for the Daily News. He held this post until shortly before his death. His reviews were witty and acerbic, and have often been compared to the writings of H.L. Mencken. On Mae West's performance in Catherine the Great, Chapman wrote, ''I'm afraid Catherine the Great will be a bust, which is one more than Miss West needs.'' In another review, Chapman described Edward Albee's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? as being ''three hours long, four characters wide, and cesspool deep.'' Chapman always edited his own work so no one would know his opinion of a show until his review appeared in the paper. His nickname ''Old Frostface'' came from his ability to give no outward reaction to a play, whether he found it hilarious, moving, or dreadful. 

In addition to his regular reviews, Chapman worked as a freelance writer for several other publications. He was commissioned to write Tell it to Sweeney, an informal history of the New York Daily News. He was also selected to edit the Best Plays series from 1947 until 1952, and Broadway's Best from 1957 to 1960. He belonged to numerous organizations including the New York Drama Circle and the Dutch Treat Society, a well-known organization of New York talents in the arts. He served as president of each of these organizations. The Fairfield County Hunt Club listed him among its members. 

Late in 1971, Chapman underwent surgery for cancer, from which he never expected to recover. He died January 19, 1972 and was cremated according to his wishes.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Scope-Content>A. Edward Newton was the leading authority on book collecting in the first half of the 20th century. The A. Edward Newton collection contains correspondence, newspaper clippings, and periodical articles, from 1919 through 1941. Ten of the letters are from Newton to Alfred Blake Trott of Denver, written between June 1932 and February 1934. They cover Newton's book collecting and travels, and mention visits and gifts that were exchanged between the Newtons and the Trotts. In nearly all of the correspondence, Newton reflects upon the political and economic climate of the time in Europe and the United States. Newton frequently sent Trott copies of articles he had written. Most were published in the Atlantic Monthly between 1922 and 1938. The collection also contains examples of articles that were privately printed by the author, and sent to a limited number of friends as Christmas greetings. Newton inscribed several of the rare pamphlets to Trott.  Two letters were written to Luella Corbin from an unknown person, and discuss Mr. and Mrs. Newton, with whom the writer had spent time in London. The collection also contains newspaper clippings, most of which refer to A. Edward Newton. Others are about book collecting in general.  The papers also contain envelopes, booklists, booklets, and notes.</Scope-Content>

      <Bio_Org_History>Wolfgang Yourgrau (1908-1979) was born on November 14, 1908, in Kattawitz, Germany, near Berlin. He attended Berlin's Humboldt University, studying theoretical physics, mathematics, and biology. After graduating, Yourgrau stayed at Humboldt to pursue a Ph.D. in physics, which he earned in 1932. While in Berlin, he also studied under Albert Einstein and was awarded the prestigious Einstein Medal in 1970 by the International Society on General Relativity and Gravitation for his work in the field of relativity. __With the Nazi rise to power in 1933, Yourgrau's staunchly anti-fascist position made him a target for harassment, so he fled Germany and was permitted to enter Palestine as a political refugee. In Palestine, Dr. Yourgrau lectured widely for the Jewish Federation of Labor while holding several teaching posts. In 1942 British authorities granted Yourgrau a license to publish The Orient, an independent German-language weekly that endeavored to quash ''every fascist movement, every attempt to restrict the right of free expression....'' The periodical was forced to cease operations when it encountered threats, boycotts, and the destruction of its office space. Undeterred by the violence, Yourgrau sought a more active role in the fight against the Axis powers, so he began editing German publications and broadcasts for the British government.

After the war, Yourgrau resumed his academic career as Head of the Department of Logic and Scientific Method at Jerusalem's School of Higher Studies. In 1948 he married Thella Garber and emigrated to South Africa, where he taught at several universities. The Yourgraus moved to the United States in 1959.

In 1963 Dr. Yourgrau left his position as Chair of the Department of History and Science at Smith College to accept a permanent post as Professor of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Denver. He later served as the Chair of the Philosophy Department at the University of Denver and was with the School's History Department before retiring in 1978.

Dr. Yourgrau was prolific as a scholar, contributing dozens of journal articles and reviews, lecturing internationally, and producing several monographs. Among his best known books are Variational Principles in Dynamics and Quantum Theory (1961) and A Treatise on Irreversible and Statistical Thermophysics (1966). In 1969 Yourgrau, together with Henry Margenau, Yale physicist and spectroscopy expert, started the international journal entitled Foundations of Physics.  Yourgrau continued to edit the journal until his death on July 18, 1979.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __National Opinion Research Center (NORC), a nonprofit corporation that provides the public with a voice in matters of national concern, was founded in 1941 under the direction of Harry H. Field (1897-1946).  During the 1930s, Harry H. Field was a businessman with strong public relation skills.  He envisioned a public opinion research center that would not attempt to make predictions or sell products, as most market research organizations did, but would give a voice to ordinary people.  With his experience working for George Gallup and support from the Field Foundation and the University of Denver, Field was able to make his dream a reality.  In October, 1941 the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) was incorporated as a nonprofit institution.  Harry Field insisted that each interviewer who collected opinions be hired in person (rather than by written application) so that only those best suited to working with a variety of people would be hired.  He also required that they receive adequate training before being sent into the field to gather information.  In 1947, Clyde W. Hart became the director of NORC.  Under his supervision, the organization moved to the University of Chicago.  He left behind a wing, called Opinion Research Center (ORC), to gather data and work on studies from the Denver campus.  This Center thrived for a few years, but was discontinued in 1949 due to financial problems.  Today, NORC continues to conduct research in the public interest from its office at the University of Chicago.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>The University of Denver played an integral part in the lives of Byron Cohn and Essie White Cohn. They met while attending the University in the early 1920s, and both received undergraduate and masters degrees from the University. They married in 1926 while they were working on their Ph.D.'s from the University of Chicago as well as teaching at the University of Denver. Byron Cohn was Chairman of the Physics Department from 1943 until 1962. Essie Cohn was a Professor of Chemistry from 1942 until 1963. They spent almost four decades as professors – he in physics and she in chemistry – at the University. Both as teachers and researchers, the Cohns were committed to the enhancement of the science curriculum at the University. __Byron Cohn was born in Chicago on November 2, 1901. He received a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering in 1923 and a master's degree in 1924 from the University of Denver. He completed his Ph.D. at the University of Chicago in 1931. He was first hired by the University of Denver in 1926, as an instructor in physics. During World War II, Cohn was on the staff of the Naval Ordnance Laboratory in Washington, D.C. After the war, he returned to the University of Denver where he was chairman of the Physics Department from 1943 to 1962. He was chairman of the governing board of the Mt. Evans High Altitude Laboratory and was active in its facility at the top of Mt. Evans. He was involved in research on cosmic rays, and hosted an international conference on cosmic rays in 1949 at Echo Lake, near Mt. Evans, which brought together 150 of the world's top physicists.

Byron Cohn was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi, Sigma Pi Sigma, and Phi Lambda Upsilon honorary societies, among others. He is listed in American Men of Science and Who's Who in America. He served as president of the Colorado-Wyoming Academy of Science and was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and authored a number of papers in the area of physics.
After Essie White Cohn's death in 1963, he remained in his professorship at the University of Denver. In 1970, he retired with Professor Emeritus status. Cohn married Margaret W. Carney in 1968. He died December 30, 1993, survived by his wife and two stepsons.

Essie White Cohn was born March 23, 1902, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Her family moved to Denver when she was a girl, and she received her preliminary education in the Denver Public Schools. She received an A.B. in 1922 and an M.A. in 1923 from the University of Denver. She received her Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1936. She became an instructor in chemistry at the University of Denver in 1923, and was named assistant professor in 1931. Essie Cohn used the High Altitude Laboratory to conduct experiments on the effects of altitude on biochemical processes. During 1941 she was visiting professor of biochemistry at George Washington University School of Medicine. She returned to the University of Denver as professor of chemistry in 1942, a position she retained for the rest of her life. She was named University of Denver outstanding faculty woman for 1955, was elected university lecturer for 1961-1962, and was presented with the Distinguished Alumni Service Award in 1961.

Essie Cohn wrote numerous articles about her research. She served as editor of the Abstract Journal of the Colorado-Wyoming Academy of Science for three years, and was editor of The Iotan, the journal of Iota Sigma Pi, the honorary chemical society for women. She was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and served as its first women vice president. She was a member of the American Chemical Society and several other academic and honorary societies. The Business and Professional Women's Club of Denver named her Woman of the Year in 1961. Essie White Cohn died March 3, 1963, and was survived by her husband, her mother and two brothers.</Bio_Org_History>

After Essie White Cohn's death in 1963, he remained in his professorship at the University of Denver. In 1970, he retired with Professor Emeritus status. Cohn married Margaret W. Carney in 1968. He died December 30, 1993, survived by his wife and two stepsons.

Essie White Cohn was born March 23, 1902, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Her family moved to Denver when she was a girl, and she received her preliminary education in the Denver Public Schools. She received an A.B. in 1922 and an M.A. in 1923 from the University of Denver. She received her Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1936. She became an instructor in chemistry at the University of Denver in 1923, and was named assistant professor in 1931. Essie Cohn used the High Altitude Laboratory to conduct experiments on the effects of altitude on biochemical processes. During 1941 she was visiting professor of biochemistry at George Washington University School of Medicine. She returned to the University of Denver as professor of chemistry in 1942, a position she retained for the rest of her life. She was named University of Denver outstanding faculty woman for 1955, was elected university lecturer for 1961-1962, and was presented with the Distinguished Alumni Service Award in 1961.

Essie Cohn wrote numerous articles about her research. She served as editor of the Abstract Journal of the Colorado-Wyoming Academy of Science for three years, and was editor of The Iotan, the journal of Iota Sigma Pi, the honorary chemical society for women. She was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and served as its first women vice president. She was a member of the American Chemical Society and several other academic and honorary societies. The Business and Professional Women's Club of Denver named her Woman of the Year in 1961. Essie White Cohn died March 3, 1963, and was survived by her husband, her mother and two brothers.</Bio_Org_History_Bio._Expansion>
      <Bio_Org_History_Biograph._History>The University of Denver played an integral part in the lives of Byron Cohn and Essie White Cohn. They met while attending the University in the early 1920s, and both received undergraduate and masters degrees from the University. They married in 1926 while they were working on their Ph.D.'s from the University of Chicago as well as teaching at the University of Denver. Byron Cohn was Chairman of the Physics Department from 1943 until 1962. Essie Cohn was a Professor of Chemistry from 1942 until 1963. They spent almost four decades as professors – he in physics and she in chemistry – at the University.

      <Abstract>Henry Winn Pinkham (1864-1947) was a minister and anti-war activitist born in Newton Centre, Massachusetts and educated at Brown University and Newton Theological School. He lived in Denver, Colorado from 1896-1912. Pinkham was ordained a Baptist minister but joined the American Unitarian Association in 1912. His outspoken opposition to U.S. involvement in World War I led him to join the Fellowship of Reconciliation.  He also served as secretary of the Association to Abolish War from 1920-1927. The Association was a pacifist group committed to standing firm against the "preparedness" movement of the times. The papers include the writings and correspondence of Henry Winn Pinkham that relate to his anti-war activities along with biographical materials on Pinkham and his wife, Wenona Osborne Pinkham.</Abstract>

      <Bio_Org_History>Henry Winn Pinkham was a minister and anti-war activist. Born in Newton Centre, Massachusetts, in 1864, he was educated at Brown University and Newton Theological School. He was ordained as a Baptist minister in 1891, and served a church in Bridgeport, Connecticut, before moving to Denver in 1896. Pinkham was very outspoken about social justice issues, and because of this he and his church were excluded from the Rocky Mountain Association of Baptist Churches. In 1909, Pinkham, along with the congregation, joined the American Unitarian Association. In 1912, Pinkham moved back to Massachusetts with his wife, Wenona Osborne Pinkham.  In 1915, Pinkham was appointed minister of the Melrose (Mass.) Unitarian Church. However, his outspoken opposition to American involvement in World War I forced him to resign his post in 1917. He was unable to obtain another pastorate, and so devoted himself to the anti-war movement. He was involved in the Fellowship of Reconciliation, and was secretary of the Association to Abolish War from 1920 to 1927. After 1927 he concentrated his energies on writing letters to the editor and articles, which were published in religious journals such as Unity, The Christian Leader, and The Christian Register, and in many major newspapers. Pinkham's vehemence and single-mindedness in his opposition to war also gained him rejections from such magazines as the Atlantic Monthly, and the displeasure of many in the leadership of the Unitarian Church.  Reverend Pinkham died in January 1947.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Abstract>Raymond Carey (1901-1972), professor of history at the University of Denver, Denver, Colorado from 1945 to 1971, conducted research on the massacre at Sand Creek, Colorado, which took place on November 29, 1864. In this battle, the troops of the Colorado Third Volunteer Regiment, commanded by Colonel John M. Chivington, attacked a group of 500 Cheyenne and Arapahoe Indians who were encamped on the banks of the Sand Creek, about 40 miles from Fort Lyon, near the present-day town of Lamar. Over 150 Indians were killed, including many women and children. Although Chivington and his benefactor, Governor John Evans, were lauded as heroes in Denver, where anti-Indian sentiment ran high, the U.S. Congress and the U.S. Army were less impressed, and both launched investigations into the incident. No indictments were made, however, and the incident remains one of the most controversial events in the history of Indian-white relations.
The collection contains bibliographies, notes, maps, military records, regimental data, correspondence, journal articles, and copies of photographs related to Carey's research on the 1864 Sand Creek Massacre in Colorado.</Abstract>

      <Bio_Org_History>Raymond Giddens Carey was born February 17, 1901, in Iola, Kansas. He received his bachelor's degree in 1923 from Southwestern College, Winfield, Kansas. He was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship, and attended Hertford College of Oxford University, Oxford, England, from which he received a second bachelor's degree in 1927 and a master's degree in 1931. He received his Ph.D. in 1945 from the University of Chicago. 

In 1942, he married Faye Kingsbury of Evansville, Indiana. They had two children, Raymond Carey, Jr., and Cynthia Carey. 

Carey came to the University of Denver in 1945. He served as chairman of the University's history department from 1945 to 1958, and was on the faculty until his retirement in 1971. Carey's field of interest was modern European history, with special emphasis on French history, the French Revolution, the Napoleonic era, and English history of the 16th and 17th centuries. Closer to home, he studied the Sand Creek Massacre, which took place in Colorado in 1864. Upon his retirement, he was named Professor Emeritus. 

Carey died on November 25, 1972. Two scholarships for history majors, the Raymond G. Carey Memorial Scholarships, were endowed in his memory.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __These records cover material of the Mile High Chapter of United Nations Association of the United States, Inc., and UNESCO. The first organized meeting of the unit was held on November 29, 1950 in the home of Mrs. Howard (Lillian) Pine and the organization was named Castle Rock (Colorado) Unit of the World Mothers for Peace (WMP). At that meeting, Mrs. Pine and a group of women from Douglas County, Colorado, met with Reverend Victoria Booth Demarest, founder of WMP, who urged them to unite ''regardless of race, nation, class or creed, to pray and strive for the abolition of war and to teach our children the ways and conditions of world peace and goodwill.'' Meetings were held each month until March 1971, and the unit was discontinued in October 1971. The influence of Lillian Pine and Victoria Demarest on the organization is reflected in the abundance of correspondence between them found within the collection. 

In October 1964, the WMP (Castle Rock Unit) voted to merge with the United Nations Association of the United States (UNA). After this date it was referred to as WMP-UNA or UNA(WMP), while the official name became ''Mile High Chapter of United Nations Association of the United States, Inc. and UNESCO''.

The interests of the Castle Rock Unit appear to have been social, humanitarian, religious, and political--in that order of importance. The meeting minute books and scrapbooks reflect the strong social orientation--photographs of friends and families both home and abroad, plans for social functions, etc.

The humanitarian element is also reflected in the meeting minutes, scrapbooks, and correspondence. The Castle Rock Unit was affiliated with other organizations, such as the Children's Friendship Fund and Meals for Millions, to promote humanitarian causes.

The religious focus of the Castle Rock Unit was Reverend Victoria Demarest. The collection contains letters from her, written sermons, religious tracts, and taped songs and sermons. The songs were performed by Demarest and her daughter, Evangeline.

Political interest was passive. A letter to President John F. Kennedy supporting the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty represents the most aggressive action. There are letters from Margaret Sanger, George McGovern (a typed form letter) and a few pamphlets condemning the Vietnam War. For the most part, the rhetoric is very general.

This collection provides insight into the role of womens' organizations in a small town during the 1950s and 1960s. While the collection offers little political insight, it does present a picture of WMP's social position; it may also be representative of one of the many peace organizations at a local level which developed under the aegis of UNESCO. It is not clear as to whether the WMP was directly sponsored by UNESCO.</Bio_Org_History>

The influence of Lillian Pine and Victoria Demarest on the organization is reflected in the abundance of correspondence between them found within the collection. 

In October 1964, the WMP (Castle Rock Unit) voted to merge with the United Nations Association of the United States (UNA). After this date it was referred to as WMP-UNA or UNA(WMP), while the official name became ''Mile High Chapter of United Nations Association of the United States, Inc. and UNESCO''.

The interests of the Castle Rock Unit appear to have been social, humanitarian, religious, and political--in that order of importance. The meeting minute books and scrapbooks reflect the strong social orientation--photographs of friends and families both home and abroad, plans for social functions, etc.

The humanitarian element is also reflected in the meeting minutes, scrapbooks, and correspondence. The Castle Rock Unit was affiliated with other organizations, such as the Children's Friendship Fund and Meals for Millions, to promote humanitarian causes.

The religious focus of the Castle Rock Unit was Reverend Victoria Demarest. The collection contains letters from her, written sermons, religious tracts, and taped songs and sermons. The songs were performed by Demarest and her daughter, Evangeline.

Political interest was passive. A letter to President John F. Kennedy supporting the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty represents the most aggressive action. There are letters from Margaret Sanger, George McGovern (a typed form letter) and a few pamphlets condemning the Vietnam War. For the most part, the rhetoric is very general.

This collection provides insight into the role of womens' organizations in a small town during the 1950s and 1960s. While the collection offers little political insight, it does present a picture of WMP's social position; it may also be representative of one of the many peace organizations at a local level which developed under the aegis of UNESCO. It is not clear as to whether the WMP was directly sponsored by UNESCO.</Bio_Org_History_Organiz._History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Stanton P. Sender was born November 11, 1932 in Seattle, Washington. He was an honor graduate of Harvard College and received a J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1956. He then returned to Washington State, where he served as Assistant Attorney General from 1956 to 1961. __In 1961 he served as a trial attorney for the United States Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) in Washington, D.C. The position at the ICC introduced him to the issue that would dominate his life: transportation. The United States methods of transporting goods and materials was evolving, from domination by railroads to a diversified system incorporating air transport and trucking. Sender became a convert to the idea of deregulation of transportation and worked to forward that goal. 

From 1963 to 1969, Sender served as transportation counsel for the United States Senate Commerce Committee. He left government service in 1969 to join Sears, Roebuck and Company as Assistant General Counsel for Transportation and Telecommunications.  This position was created by Sears to work with Congress, lobbying on behalf of the company on transportation issues.  Sender was an integral part of the Sears management team, and would often steer the company around troublesome transportation issues that were subject to ongoing legislation.  He was with Sears for 20 years, during which time much important transportation legislation and legal precedents emerged. 

Upon leaving Sears in 1989, Sender joined the Washington, D.C. law firm of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius, where he continued to specialize in transportation law and lobbying.  He was treasurer of the National Industrial Transportation League and belonged to many transportation-related organizations.  He was chosen ''Man of the Year'' by Chilton's Distribution in 1986.  

Stanton P. Sender died November 7, 1995, several days after suffering a massive heart attack.  He was survived by his wife, Michelle Sender, and two sons, Jason and Todd.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Notes>The HTML finding aid indicated that Stanton P. Sender was survived by his wife, Michelle R. Vale.  All the other information we have indicates that Michelle Sender was our donor and Stanton P. Sender's widow.  We contacted the person who facilitated the acquisition of both the Sender papers and the ICC collection, and he indicated that he had always dealt with Michelle as Michelle Sender, but suggested a possible remarriage.  I  have found on the Transportation Consumer Protection Council, Inc. Vol. III, Issue 20, November-December, 1998 that they still refer to Sender's widow as Michelle Sender.  Therefore, the decision was made to remove the reference to the name ''Vale'' from this record.</Notes>

      <Bio_Org_History>Henry Augustus Buchtel was born September 30, 1847, near Akron, Ohio, to Dr. Jonathan B. and Eliza Newcomer Buchtel. The family moved to Indiana in 1848, where Henry spent his youth. He attended Asbury (now DePauw) University in Greencastle, Indiana, for one year, after which he worked in a wholesale drug-house in Chicago, and then in a wholesale and retail grocery business in South Bend, Indiana. Finding himself drawn to the ministry, he returned to Asbury University to finish his studies to become a Methodist minister. __He received his A.B. degree in 1872. Soon after graduation he married Mary Stevenson, and began his ministry as a missionary to Bulgaria. He returned to Indiana to take a pastorate in Zionsville, and subsequently served churches in Greencastle, Knightstown, Richmond and Lafayette, Indiana. In 1885 he was called to be the minister at the Evans Chapel in Denver, Colorado. During his five-year pastorate in Denver, he built Trinity Church and substantially increased the size of the congregation. He returned East in 1891 to serve churches in New York and New Jersey. In 1899 he was called by the University of Denver to serve as Chancellor, which post he began on January 1, 1900. When Buchtel assumed the position of Chancellor, the University of Denver was greatly in debt. Buchtel worked diligently to rectify the situation, touring the state giving speeches and sermons, and becoming involved in the Denver Chamber of Commerce. Within three years he had raised enough money to cover the University's debt, and had more than doubled the student body. Buchtel's tenure at the University was also marked by an aggressive building campaign. He oversaw the construction of the Library (funded by Andrew Carnegie), Science Hall, the Memorial Chapel (later named Buchtel Chapel), and the Gymnasium. In 1906, Buchtel was persuaded to run for Governor of Colorado on the Republican ticket. Political infighting in the Democratic Party leadership helped to ensure Buchtel's victory. He served the state from 1907 to 1909, while continuing to work as Chancellor of the University. Despite his successful term as Governor, he declined to run again in 1909, electing to devote his full energies to the University of Denver. Buchtel suffered a stroke in 1920 that forced his retirement from his position as Chancellor. He died four years later, on October 22, 1924.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Scope-Content>The Freed World War II Scrapbook and Map Collection at the University of Denver consists of 99 individual scrapbooks covering war-related issues from August 1939 through September 1947. The scrapbooks are dated, however, the individual clippings are not consistently dated or identified as to source. The newspaper clippings were probably from the two Denver newspapers, The Rocky Mountain News and The Denver Post. In addition to stories on the progress of the war, the scrapbooks contain political cartoons, editorials and commentaries on subjects ranging from how the war was managed to the effectiveness of the American allies. The scrapbooks cover the period from the beginning of hostilities in Europe, sparked by the September 1, 1939 invasion of Poland by the Germans. The United States' entry into the war following the Pearl Harbor attack of December 7, 1941, is covered in scrapbook 32. The scrapbooks extend beyond the end of the war in 1945 to cover the establishment of the United Nations and the Nuremberg Trials.

Complementing the scrapbooks is a selection of Newsmaps, weekly publications of the Public Relations Division of the United States War Department. The Newsmaps are in large poster format and include maps, pictures and text. They cover the progress of the war and have been characterized as propaganda rather than the disinterested dissemination of information. Together, the scrapbooks and maps provide a good picture of an American citizen following the progress of World War II.</Scope-Content>

      <Bio_Org_History>George Richardson was born July 21, 1838, in Northfield, Vermont. His family moved to a farm near Marengo, Illinois, when he was a small boy. He was raised as a Methodist and graduated from Garrett Biblical Institute in Evanston, Illinois, about 1861. He married Justina B. Ranney on August 25, 1862. He was the first pastor of the Lawrence Street Methodist Episcopal Church in Denver, Colorado in 1864. When Colorado Seminary (later named the University of Denver) opened that year, he added teaching to his pastoral duties. Richardson served as President of Colorado Seminary in 1865 and 1866, after which he resigned due to ill health caused by overwork.

After leaving Colorado Seminary, he served as pastor in Empire and Georgetown, Colorado, for a year before returning to Illinois. He returned to Denver in 1880 to homestead in the district known as Argo, and became a farmer and businessman. He was president of Central Savings Bank from 1896 until 1903. In 1903 he was elected a delegate to the Charter Convention that gave Denver home rule. He died in Denver on July 4, 1909. The Richardsons were the parents of five boys and two girls. __Charles Mancil Deardorff was born in Kansas on October 3, 1873, the son of Thomas Collins Deardorff and Ophilia Marie Ingalls. He attended a country school and taught in such a school for two years before moving to Salina, Kansas, to attend Kansas Wesleyan University. He was supported in his educational endeavors by both his parents and two older sisters who were teachers. Another supportive relative was a step-uncle, John Heisler, who lived in Denver. 

In 1896, Deardorff moved to Denver and enrolled at the University of Denver, from which he graduated in 1899. He then became a reporter for the Denver Republican. He registered as a law clerk in his uncle's law office and entered the University of Denver Law School in 1901. He worked his way through law school as a librarian in the School of Law Library. Deardorff was admitted to the bar in 1904, the same year he met Alice N. Richardson, a University of Denver graduate and daughter of George Richardson. Deardorff and Alice Richardson were married June 26, 1907 in a ceremony officiated by the bride's father.  In addition to his law practice and many civic activities, Charles Deardorff was interested in family genealogy. Deardoff was an honorary life member of the Colorado Bar Association, a member of Masonic Lodge 84, Chapter 29 of the Royal Arch Masons, and Colorado Commandery of the Knights Templar. He served on the board of Trinity Methodist Church and was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity. Alice Deardorff died in 1948. Charles died January 23, 1962, survived by three of his four daughters.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Scope-Content>The Richardson and Deardorff Families Papers were collected and preserved by Charles Deardorff and his wife, Alice, who was the daughter of George Richardson. The collection comes from both the Richardson and the Deardorff families, but consists primarily of genealogic research on the family of George Richardson, the second president of Colorado Seminary (later named the University of Denver).  

The collection reflects the Deardorffs' interest in genealogy. It includes genealogy research conducted by Charles Deardorff on the Richardson family, and Deardorff’s autobiography.  The collection includes diaries (1861-1864), a diploma and a stamp collection.  The collection also includes correspondence, postcards, an address book, recipes, receipts, a history, newspaper clippings, notes, a speech, memorabilia, photographs, and glass plate negatives. There is no clear indication of which member of the family compiled the collection of religious tracts, but several are inscribed as the property of Alice Richardson Deardorff.  The collection brings together information on over two generations of a family with close connections to Denver, Colorado and the University of Denver. The westward movement of culture and commerce is reflected in the lives and memorabilia of the families and individuals who contributed to the collection.</Scope-Content>

      <Abstract>Lyle Wesley Dorsett (1938-  ) served as Professor of History at the University of Denver, Denver, Colorado from 1972-1983, specializing in urban history. He earned his Ph.D. in history from the University of Missouri in 1965. His dissertation on the political machine of Kansas City, Missouri Alderman Jim Pendergast was published in 1968 under the title The Pendergast machine.

      <Abstract>The collection consists of oral histories by residents of the University Park neighborhood in Denver, Colorado and recount life in the south Denver neighborhood from early 1900 to the mid-1980s as part of 14-year old Barry Matchett's 1986 Eagle Scout project. Residents relate the history of University Park including the trolley that served the area, grocery stores and holiday celebrations. The subdivision was platted in 1892 and the University of Denver moved to its University Park Campus in the early 1890s. University Park School, part of the Arapahoe County School District, was built in 1893 on the corner of East Iliff Avenue and South St. Paul Street. In 1894 the Chamberlin Observatory was dedicated at Observatory Park on the corner of East Warren Avenue and South Fillmore Street. University Park Methodist Church was located at South University Boulevard and East Warren Avenue.</Abstract>

      <Arrang_Organiz>The collection is organized into two Series.  1.  Oral History Tapes, 1986.  2.  Research Material, 1986.</Arrang_Organiz>
      <Bio_Org_History>In 1986 the University Park neighborhood was considered one of Denver, Colorado's venerable historic neighborhoods, full of stately homes and mature trees. In that year, 14-year-old Barry Matchett elected to earn an Eagle Scout badge by completing an oral history project with some of the older residents of the area. He collected 50 oral histories on cassette tapes. The subjects discussed ranged from the trolley that served the area to local grocery stores. There was a close-knit feeling to the community that was reflected in reminiscences about Christmas and Fourth of July celebrations. __The area owes its name to the University of Denver, which moved to its University Park campus in the 1890s. The area was platted and became the University Park Subdivision in 1892. The current boundaries of the University Park neighborhood are Interstate Highway 25 on the north, Yale Avenue on the south, University Boulevard on the west, and Colorado Boulevard on the east. University Park School was built in 1893 at the corner of East Iliff Avenue and South St. Paul Street as part of the Arapahoe County School District. In 1894 the Chamberlin Observatory was dedicated at Observatory Park, at the corner of East Warren Avenue and South Fillmore Street. The neighborhood grew, with a contingent of professors and administrators associated with the University sharing the neighborhood with other residents. Fraternity and sorority houses dotted the landscape. University Park Methodist Church, located at South University Boulevard and East Warren Avenue, became a fixture of the neighborhood. 

Barry Matchett donated his cassette tapes to the University of Denver Archives so that they would be available for research. In an article in the Denver Post, he explained how much fun he had collecting the tapes, and that it was much more fun than learning facts from a history book. He hoped that his work would be useful to others wanting to learn about the history of University Park.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The Park Hill neighborhood in the northeast section of Denver, Colorado, became racially integrated during the 1950s, when African-Americans and other minorities moved into what had previously been an exclusively white community. The racial disharmony and tensions that integration caused led the clergy and concerned citizens of the area to form a community group to promote racial harmony. In 1959, this group formulated the idea for a community group, called the Park Hill Action Committee (Interdenominational).  The organization was renamed the Greater Park Hill Community, Incorporated and was involved with community and neighborhood relations, capital development, community assistance, protection of residences, fair housing, cultural and recreational programs, dissemination of information to residents, and publishing Park Hill Community assets to families interested in moving to the area. The group targeted downward trends in the community and offered solutions through community education.  The members also assisted in zoning regulation.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Robert Earl Roeder was born on May 16, 1931. In 1951 he graduated from the College of William and Mary with a bachelor's degree in philosophy. He received his masters and doctorate degrees in history from Harvard University in 1953 and 1959, respectively. On August 29, 1953 he married Nancy Waggoner. While at Harvard, he held a teaching fellowship in history and literature from 1953 to 1954. He served in the U.S. Army Counter-Intelligence Corps from 1954 until 1956. He then returned to teaching at Harvard, where he again held a teaching fellowship, and became an instructor in history in 1958. From 1959 to 1962 he held the position of Assistant Professor of History at the University of Chicago. He left Chicago in 1962 to take the position of Professor of History at the University of Denver, where he remained until his retirement in 1995. 

During his time at the University of Denver, Roeder was instrumental in both curriculum development and research program coordination. He served as chair of the History Department during 1985-1986, when the Core Curriculum program was implemented, and coordinated the Civilizations Compared component of the Core. In 1986, he accepted the position of Venture Chairman for the faculty of the Arts and Humanities. In this position he primarily generated grant proposals and coordinated grant projects. He also co-directed a major National Endowment for the Humanities grant for the University. Roeder contributed to numerous publications, and held memberships in the American History Association, the Organization of American Historians and the Rocky Mountain Social Science Association. 

In 1990, Roeder took on the additional duties of Special Assistant to the Provost for the strategic planning initiative, which began in 1990 as a precursor to a major capital campaign. Together with Catherine (Kitty) Sweeney, he established an office that provided research support to the Coordinating Committee for Strategic Planning. The office gathered statistics and reference materials for the Committee and its subcommittees, scheduled meetings, compiled minutes and handled other administrative functions. 

In 1991 Roeder returned to teaching part-time, and in 1992 contracted with Harcourt Brace to write a major new world history textbook. He retired in 1995 to concentrate on his writing. Bob Roeder passed away on November 15, 1998.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Ruth Murray Underhill, University of Denver professor of anthropology and world-renowned anthropologist, was born in Ossining-on-the-Hudson, New York, on August 22, 1883 to an upper-middle class Quaker family. She graduated from Vassar College in 1905 with a bachelor's degree in comparative literature. After graduating she traveled to Europe, and studied at the London School of Economics. She worked for the Red Cross in Italy during World War I. After the war she found work in New York as a social worker in poor Italian communities. Fascinated by different cultures and societies, she decided to pursue graduate studies at Columbia University. There she met Ruth Benedict, and studied with Franz Boas, the father of American anthropology. __In the early 1930s, Underhill traveled to Arizona to conduct fieldwork for her doctoral program. There she met Chona, an elderly Tohono O'odham woman, whose biography she wrote in 1936 -- the first biography of an American Indian woman. During this work Underhill developed a life-long affection for the Tohono O'odham people and other southwestern tribes, including the Mohave and the Navajo.  After receiving her Ph.D. from Columbia in 1934, she went to work for the U.S. Indian Service (later the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs). She was Assistant Supervisor of Indian Education from 1934-1942, and was Supervisor from 1942-1948. Upon her retirement, at the age of 65, she moved to Denver, Colorado and taught at the University of Denver until 1952. She remained active with the University and the Department of Anthropology until two years before her death, in 1984, a week before her 100th anniversary.  She was accorded many honors during her lifetime. In 1962 she received an honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of Denver. The University of Colorado awarded her an honorary Doctor of Science degree in 1965. The American Anthropological Association honored her with a Special Recognition citation in 1984. She also received a Friendship Award from the White Buffalo Council of American Indians.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Scope-Content>The Ruth Underhill papers consists primarily of materials from the latter half of her life. The collection contains course materials from her teaching tenure at the University of Denver--lecture notes, exams, syllabi, course descriptions and bibliographies. Her work with American Indian tribes in education, training, employment, and political issues is reflected in a variety of materials including Bureau of Indian Affairs' publications and memos, newspaper clippings and newsletters, convention papers and correspondence from such groups as the National Congress of American Indians.  Underhill was involved in the Indian Visiting Program of the American Friends Service Committee, a peace and service organization affiliated with the Quaker Church.  Materials concerning this program and other Quaker activities are included in the collection.  Underhill's publishing activities in the 1950's and 1960's are represented by manuscripts, galley proofs, and typescripts of a number of her books, including Earth People: The Story of the Navaho, First Came the Family, Red Man's Religion, and Red Man's America.  Finally, a large part of the collection consists of magazine articles and reprints of journal articles about topics of interest to Underhill.  These topics range from anthropology and archeology of North and South American Indians to astronomy, climatology and geology, the origins of humans, biology, genetics, the human brain, religion and mythology.  Underhill's broad professional and personal interests are reflected in this collection, which focuses on her later years.</Scope-Content>

      <Bio_Org_History>Ruth Suckow was born in Hawarden, Iowa on August 6, 1892. She was the second of two daughters born to William John Suckow and Anna Mary (Kluckholm), children of German immigrants. William Suckow was a Congregationalist minister in various Iowa towns throughout his life. Anna Suckow was limited in her duties as a minister's wife due to a thyroid disorder, thus she focused her ambitions on her husband and daughters Emma and Ruth. As a child, Ruth accompanied her father on his calls throughout the Iowa countryside where she became acquainted with people who would later serve as models for characters in her writings. From an early age Ruth composed stories that she folded into small books that she decorated. __Suckow attended schools in Algona, Fort Dodge, Manchester, and Grinnell, Iowa, graduating from high school in Grinnell in 1910. She entered Grinnell College in 1910, where she specialized in English and appeared in many theatrical productions. While at Grinnell, Suckow worked for one summer as a waitress at Yellowstone National Park. She left Grinnell in 1913 to attend the Curry School of Expression in Boston, from which she graduated in 1915. Suckow then moved to Denver, where she joined her sister, Emma, who had recently moved from Iowa to seek relief from tuberculosis. Ruth Suckow enrolled at the University of Denver, where, as a student of English, she received a Bachelor of Arts in 1917 and a Master of Arts in 1918. As a graduate student, Suckow was an assistant to Dr. Ida Kruse McFarlane, head of the English Department at the University. Suckow spent the summer of 1918 employed as a waitress at Long's Peak Lodge in Estes Park, Colorado, accompanied by a friend and former student, Amy Carlson (later Mrs. Amy Buchanan).

While at the University of Denver, Ruth Suckow decided upon a writing career. Her first published writings were poems that appeared in 1918 in Touchstone and The Midland. She worked during the winter of 1918-1919 as a writer of automobile guide books for a Denver map company. At this time, Suckow decided to take up beekeeping as a steady source of income as she began to pursue her writing career. After a brief apprenticeship in beekeeping under Delia Watson, Suckow left Denver in 1919 to join her recently widowed father in Earlville, Iowa. There she established the Orchard Apiary at the edge of town. The venture was quite successful until sold by Suckow late in 1926. During this time, she lived in Earlville and McGregor, Iowa and spent winters in Chicago, Iowa City, and New York City.

The first story published by Ruth Suckow, ''Uprooted'', appeared in the February 1921 issue of The Midland. Suckow served as assistant editor of The Midland for a half year in 1921-1922. The editor of The Midland, John T. Frederick, urged her to send work to H. L. Mencken, who encouraged, criticized, and promoted Ruth Suckow as a writer. She frequently contributed to Mencken's publication, The Smart Set, between 1921 and 1923. In 1924, Suckow's novella, ''Country People,'' was serialized in The Century Magazine and was published by Alfred A. Knopf later that year. Knopf published The Odyssey of a Nice Girl in 1925, and a collection of her 1921-1926 stories under the title Iowa Interiors in 1926. Meanwhile, Suckow also contributed articles to The American Mercury (1924-1927, 1929).

After selling the Orchard Apiary in 1926, Suckow moved to New York City, where she lived until 1928. Knopf published The Bonney Family in 1928. Suckow contributed articles to Harper's Monthly Magazine (1927-1929, 1936, 1939), The Bookman (1927), The Saturday Review of Literature (1927), and The Outlook (1929).

In September 1928, Suckow moved to San Diego with her fiancée, Ferner Nuhn, a writer and critic also from Iowa. They were married on March 11, 1929 and moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico where they lived until November of the same year. While Suckow was in Santa Fe, Cora was published and her articles appeared not only in such literary publications as Harper's Monthly Magazine and The American Mercury, but also in popular publications such as Good Housekeeping (1929-1931, 1935) and Pictorial Review (1929). Suckow and Nuhn returned to Iowa in late 1929 and remained there through part of 1930. The Kramer Girls appeared serialized in Good Housekeeping from December 1929 through March 1930, and was published as a book by Knopf later in 1930. Suckow and her husband lived in Dorset, Vermont in 1930-1931, where their friends included Dorothy Canfield Fisher and her family. A collection of short stories first published in 1925-1929 appeared in 1931 as Children and Older People. Ruth and Ferner returned to Iowa in 1931 and resided in Cedar Falls (1931-1932) and in Des Moines (1932-1933). Suckow was a guest instructor at Iowa State Teacher's College, University of Iowa, and Indiana University during this time, and devoted considerable time to writing her most famous and ambitious novel, The Folks. In the latter half of 1933, Suckow and Nuhn lived at the MacDowell Memorial Colony in Peterborough, New Hampshire and at Artists' Colony, Yaddo, Saratoga Springs, New York, and spent a portion of 1934 in Altadena, California.

The Folks was published by Farrar &amp; Rinehart in 1934 and became one of the most popular books of the year. Around this time, Ferner Nuhn began writing pamphlets and other material for the Department of Agriculture, and the couple moved to Washington, D. C., where they lived for a year. Suckow wrote her first short stories in three years, which appeared in Good Housekeeping and Scribner's in 1935. Later in 1935, Ruth and Ferner moved to Fairfax, Virginia after spending the summer at Robert Frost's home in South Shaftsbury, Vermont. In 1936, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Ruth Suckow to the Farm Tenancy Committee.

After a collection of Suckow's short stories was published by Farrar &amp; Rinehart in 1936 under the title, Carry Over, she wrote less frequently. In late 1936, Suckow and Nuhn moved to Cedar Falls, Iowa, where they remained until 1948. Two stories by Suckow were published in 1939 and Farrar &amp; Rinehart published the book New Hope in 1942. Nuhn devoted himself to writing, The Wind Blew from the East, also published in 1942. The couple also operated a rental agency and encouraged local interest in literature and the arts.

Ruth and Ferner were pacifists who supported conscientious objectors during World War II. Under the sponsorship of the American Friends Service Committee, Church of the Brethren, and the Mennonites, Suckow spoke, visited, and read manuscripts at civilian public service camps, units in mental hospitals, firefighting units, and starvation units. The couple later became active members of the Society of Friends (Quakers). Because Suckow began to develop arthritis, they moved to Tucson, Arizona in 1948. In 1952, they moved to Claremont, California, where they bought a home. The first Suckow book to appear in a decade, Some Others and Myself, was published by Rinehart &amp; Company in 1952. Over the next few years, Suckow wrote stories which appeared in Midland Schools (1953), Friends Intelligencer (1955), and The Georgia Review (1955, 1958). Her last book, The John Wood Case, was published by The Viking Press in 1959. Ruth Suckow died in Claremont, California on January 23, 1960.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Edwin C. Johnson served Colorado as State Representative, State Senator, three-time Governor and three-term U.S. Senator. He was born January 1, 1884 in Scandia, Kansas, but spent most of his youth in Nebraska. He attended Lincoln High School where he had William Jennings Bryan as a substitute teacher. After he graduated in 1903, Johnson became a train dispatcher in Fairmont, Nebraska.

In 1909 he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and was advised to go to Colorado. He and his wife of two years, the former Fern Claire Armitage, moved to Colorado, first to Fountain and then to a homestead near Craig. He ranched, managed a farmers’ cooperative milling elevator, and taught school before being elected to the Colorado Legislature in 1922. He moved on to the Colorado Senate for the 1931-1932 session, and was elected Governor of Colorado as a Democrat for the first time in 1933. Faced with the problems of the Great Depression, he initiated his own recovery program on tax reduction, highway and construction projects, balanced budget legislation, and civil service reform. Despite the success of his program, Johnson created controversy in 1936 when he called out the National Guard to prevent Mexican farm workers from entering Colorado. Bowing to the pressure of federal and state officials, he reversed his stance. 

After two terms as Governor, he was elected to the U.S. Senate, taking office in 1937. He continued to be known as an isolationist, opposing America’s involvement in foreign wars. He was a strong supporter of people in the military and, as Vice-Chair of the Military Affairs Committee, was instrumental in the creation of the G.I. Bill of Rights, Lowry Air Force Base, and the U.S. Air Force Academy. Once the United States entered World War II, Johnson was fully behind the war effort. 

After the War, Johnson was instrumental in creating the interstate highway system in Colorado, especially I-70. He supported atomic energy and its effect on Colorado uranium mining, and he was very interested in both reclamation projects and oil shale development. He served as president of the Western Baseball League, and was instrumental in the construction of Mile High Stadium in Denver. He was inducted into the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame in 1968. He died on May 30, 1970.</Bio_Org_History>

He ranched, managed a farmers’ cooperative milling elevator, and taught school before being elected to the Colorado Legislature in 1922. He moved on to the Colorado Senate for the 1931-1932 session, and was elected Governor of Colorado as a Democrat for the first time in 1933. Faced with the problems of the Great Depression, he initiated his own recovery program on tax reduction, highway and construction projects, balanced budget legislation, and civil service reform. Despite the success of his program, Johnson created controversy in 1936 when he called out the National Guard to prevent Mexican farm workers from entering Colorado. Bowing to the pressure of federal and state officials, he reversed his stance. 

After two terms as Governor, he was elected to the U.S. Senate, taking office in 1937. He continued to be known as an isolationist, opposing America’s involvement in foreign wars. He was a strong supporter of people in the military and, as Vice-Chair of the Military Affairs Committee, was instrumental in the creation of the G.I. Bill of Rights, Lowry Air Force Base, and the U.S. Air Force Academy. Once the United States entered World War II, Johnson was fully behind the war effort. 

After the War, Johnson was instrumental in creating the interstate highway system in Colorado, especially I-70. He supported atomic energy and its effect on Colorado uranium mining, and he was very interested in both reclamation projects and oil shale development. He served as president of the Western Baseball League, and was instrumental in the construction of Mile High Stadium in Denver. He was inducted into the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame in 1968. He died on May 30, 1970.</Bio_Org_History_Biograph._History>

      <Scope-Content>The Edwin C. Johnson Papers consist primarily of material related to Johnson’s work on the Upper Colorado River Commission. Associated closely with the Commission was the Colorado Water Conservation Board, which spearheaded much of the research and lobbying initiatives on behalf of Colorado water. The collection has extensive, but not complete, meeting minutes and memoranda of the Colorado Water Conservation Board. The Colorado River Storage Project served as a vehicle for both water conservation and water allocation. The projects that were funded, determined which areas of the country would receive the most water from the Colorado River. Johnson worked closely with the Colorado Congressional delegation, and the collection includes correspondence from Senators Gordon Allott and Peter Dominick as well as Representatives Byron Rogers and Wayne Aspinall. 
The papers also include speeches, newsletters, news releases, newspaper clippings, brochures, treaties, hearing transcripts, congressional bills, and reports.</Scope-Content>

      <Abstract>John Arthur Love (1916-2002) was governor of Colorado from 1962-1973. His gubernatorial terms saw increases in spending for education and pollution control, as well as the first state law legalizing abortion, and a "sunshine law", which opened government meetings to the public. After leaving the governorship, he became Director of the Office of Energy Policy under President Richard M. Nixon. He later served as CEO and Director of the Denver-based Ideal Basic Industries, taught history at the University of Northern Colorado, and served as a trustee of the University of Denver.  The papers of John A. Love consist primarily of materials and correspondence related to his campaigns for governor of Colorado in 1962, 1966, and 1970 and his involvement with the Republican Governors Association. It also includes personal correspondence, documents and political correspondence relating to his terms in office and to the 1964 presidential election, and research publications on Colorado politics and demographics.</Abstract>

      <Bio_Org_History>John A. Love was born November 29, 1916 in Illinois. When he was a child, his family moved to Colorado and settled in Colorado Springs in hopes of curing his father's respiratory illness. He graduated from The Cheyenne Mountain School in 1934 and then proceeded to the University of Denver, where he earned a B.A. degree in 1938 and a law degree in 1941. He was on the staff of the University of Denver student newspaper, The Clarion, and served as editor his senior year. He also served as president of the Rocky Mountain Collegiate Press Association. World War II found Love in the U.S. Navy Aviation program. He was a pilot of amphibious bombers for over two years, earning two Distinguished Flying Crosses and the Air Medal with clusters. After the war he returned to Colorado Springs and opened a law practice, specializing in civil and corporate law. __Love was a political neophyte when he was elected governor of Colorado in 1962. It was his first elective office, but the Colorado Springs lawyer used his platform of lower taxes to defeat the incumbent, Stephen McNichols. He made good on this promise to lower taxes. During his three terms as governor, he was active in promoting Colorado throughout the United States. The tourist industry boomed during his tenure, as did the ski industry. With the support of Governor Love, Colorado was proposed as a host for the 1976 Winter Olympics. That opportunity was abandoned when, in 1972, a referendum refused to allow any state money to be used to stage the games. Love was a political moderate. His term in office saw increased funding for education as well as important water and air pollution legislation. In 1967, he signed the first state law in the U.S. legalizing abortion, and later approved the ''Sunshine Law,'' which opened government meetings to the public. 
In 1973, Love resigned as governor to serve as the first Director of the Office of Energy Policy under President Richard M. Nixon. He left that position after five months and returned to Colorado and the private sector. He served on the Board of Directors and as CEO of Ideal Basic Industries, a cement manufacturer, as well as counsel to the Denver law firm of Davis, Graham &amp; Stubbs. He also taught history at the University of Northern Colorado, and served multiple terms on the Board of Trustees of the University of Denver.
Love married Ann Daniels in 1942. She died in 1999. Governor Love died January 21, 2002, and was survived by his three children, Daniel Arthur, Major General John Andrew, and Colorado Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Love Kourlis.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Abstract>Milton Mincha Schayer (1876-1935) was a Denver, Colorado businessman. Born to German-Jewish parents, he was active in many civic and religious organizations in Denver in the early part of the twentieth century.  He wrote a weekly syndicated column titled, "Things to think about," which appeared in a variety of Jewish newspapers around the country.
In 1927,  Schayer wrote to a number of Nobel Prize-winning scientists, literary figures, university presidents and judges inquiring about their views on religion and science. He expressed a concern that college students of the day were “drifting away from all religious impulses,” and that this notion was based on “a seeming conflict between the discoveries of scientists and the claims of religionists.” Given the in-depth scientific studies and life experience of these figures, he wished to know their ideas on the subject, for possible publication. Most of the correspondents either did not want their views published, or referred Schayer to writings on the matter that were already published.</Abstract>

      <Bio_Org_History>Milton Mincha Schayer was born in Denver, Colorado, in 1876 to German-Jewish parents. When he was ten the family moved to Galveston, Texas, where he began working as an errand boy at the Galveston Fruit Company. He was promoted in the company, but moved back to Denver after the Galveston flood of 1900. In Denver he entered the stock and bond business, and in 1920 founded the Bankers Building and Loan Association, and served as its first president and treasurer. 

He was active in many civic and religious organizations. He was director of the Denver Chamber of Commerce, which recognized him as Denver’s “most valuable citizen” in 1925. He was a member of Temple Emanuel, president of the Central Jewish Aid Society, and president of the Denver Lodge of the Independent Order of B’nai B’rith. He was a member of the Masons, the Denver Press Club, the Philosophical Society, and the Colorado Bankers Association. He wrote a weekly syndicated column titled “Things to Think About,” which appeared in the Jewish News in the Rocky Mountain Region, and a number of East Coast newspapers. He was also active in a literary group, discussions of which prompted the inquirys he sent to prominent scientists and men of letters.

Schayer was married twice, first to Elsie Reinach, who died in 1919, and then to Jane S. Bear. He had two children, Helen Elsie and Charles Milton. He died in 1935.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The Colorado Poetry Fellowship was incorporated in 1934 with the purpose of ''encouraging the development and recognition of the poets of our own region [and] sponsoring programs by distinguished guest poets and critics.'' Also integral to the purpose of the group was their participation in International Poetry Week, for which they organized programs and events. Formed in the spirit of the women's clubs which were so prevalent in American culture at the time, the leadership and membership of the group was primarily female. Nonetheless, men were welcomed into the group, and Levette J. Davidson, professor of English at the University of Denver, was on the Board of the group. Ida Kruse McFarlane, another well-known University of Denver faculty member, served as an advisor to the Board in its early years.

By 1938 the Fellowship had nearly 380 members. They held quarterly meetings, at which they listened to local poets present their work. They also organized lecture-recitals, which featured nationally known poets. Among those that the Fellowship brought to Denver were May Sarton, Langston Hughes, Don Blanding, Robert Frost, Haniel Long and William Rose Benét. 

The Fellowship also published a periodic poetry magazine, Timberlines. The magazine featured regional poets, listings of poetry
 events, and listings and reviews of new poetry books. Timberlines was published from 1938 to 1964, when the Fellowship
 disbanded.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Abstract>Margaret (Peggy) Shippen Arnold (1760-1804) was the second wife of Benedict Arnold, with whom he had five children. Though her involvement in her husband's treason against the United States and association with the British is not clear, she did move the family with him to England and then to Canada and finally back to England where they lived in exile. Benedict Arnold died in 1801 and Margaret provided for her family, managing business affairs for her children and also his children from a previous marriage.  The Arnold Family papers contain correspondence between members of the Benedict Arnold Family; receipts, legal papers, as well as correspondence relating to their business affairs and land ownership in Canada; also includes biographical notes and journal articles about Margaret Shippen Arnold; passport; samples of Benedict Arnold's hair.</Abstract>

      <Bio_Org_History>Margaret (Peggy) Shippen Arnold was born the youngest of three daughters to Judge Edward Shippen in 1760. She was raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where she met and married Benedict Arnold at the age of 18 in April 1779. Benedict Arnold was then 38 years old, a Colonel in the U.S. Army and widowed by his first wife, Margaret Mansfield Arnold, with whom he had three sons including Richard and Henry Arnold. __In May 1779 Benedict Arnold started negotiating with the British and committed treason against the United States. He was forced to escape in a ship, called the Vulture. The family moved to England, then to Canada and back to England where he and Peggy settled in exile with their five children: Edward Shippen Arnold (1780-1813), James Robertson Arnold (1781-1854), George Arnold (1878-1828) Sophia Matilda Arnold (1785-1828), and William Fitch Arnold (1798-1846). 

When Benedict Arnold died in 1801 he left his family in debt, and Peggy took on the burden of the family finances and educating her children. She died in 1804.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Elwood Murray was born in 1897 and raised on a farm near Hastings, Nebraska. He earned a B.A. degree in 1922 from Hastings College, with majors in English and American History. He worked his way through college by milking cows and selling pianos. In July 1924 he finished his master’s degree in Education and Speech at the University of Iowa. His first teaching job was at the high school in Ord, Nebraska, in 1922-1923. He then worked at Abraham Lincoln High School in Council Bluffs, Iowa, Midland College, and Purdue University. He was awarded the third speech Ph.D. in the country at the University of Iowa in February 1931, with an emphasis on the Psychology of Speech. __In 1931 he obtained perhaps the only speech position available during that year of the Depression, Associate Professor of Speech and Dramatic Arts at the University of Denver. He became chairman of the department the next year. The publishing of his first book, a joining of speech with personality development, The Speech Personality (Lippincott, 1937, 1942) brought many advanced students to the University. The first Ph.D. in Speech was offered in 1945 with the assistance of the growing faculty and administration. In December 1949 Murray initiated the founding of the National Society for the Study of Communication, later called the International Communication Association. In 1939 he participated in the first of his five seminars with Alfred Korzybski in Chicago. Jointly with M. (Marjorie) Kendig he programmed the 1942 and 1950 congresses in general semantics held at the University of Denver. Integrative Speech (Dryden Press, 1952) was one of the first textbooks to introduce general semantics in the teaching of communication. In 1950 he introduced the first Laboratory in Interpersonal Communication in the country. This was followed in 1964 with an Interdisciplinary Analogue Laboratory on Structures, Patterns and Themes. Primarily for graduate students, teachers and administrators in higher education, the Laboratory was designed to explore analogous structures and systems of knowledge across the sciences and humanities in order to create greater understanding of the whole of human knowledge. 

Murray retired from the School of Speech in 1962, although he continued to be involved in the department afterward. He held visiting professor appointments at a number of other universities, was the joint programmer of six interdisciplinary conferences, and presented papers at a number of others. His book Speech: Science-Art was published by Bobbs-Merrill in 1969. He presented the 27th annual Alfred Korzybski Memorial Lecture to the Institute of General Semantics in 1978. His numerous articles appeared in a variety of communications journals.

Murray married Emma Prince in 1924. They had three children. Professor Murray died in 1988.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The Colorado Association of Law Libraries (CoALL) began in 1977 as the Colorado Consortium of Law Libraries. In 1984 the organization petitioned the American Association of Law Libraries to become an official chapter of that organization. Their petition was accepted, and the name was changed to Colorado Association of Law Libraries to reflect their new affiliation. The main goals of CoALL are to ''(a) promote librarianship; (b) develop and increase the usefulness of law libraries; (c) cultivate the science of law librarianship; and (d) foster a spirit of cooperation among the members of the profession, particularly those in Colorado.'' The Association has supported its members through a variety of professional activities, including mentoring and grant programs and continuing education. One of its main activities is an annual Legal Institute, which consists of a day-long workshop on various topics of concern to law librarians. CoALL continues to play a vital role in law librarianship in the state.

The main goals of CoALL are to ''(a) promote librarianship; (b) develop and increase the usefulness of law libraries; (c) cultivate the science of law librarianship; and (d) foster a spirit of cooperation among the members of the profession, particularly those in Colorado.'' The Association has supported its members through a variety of professional activities, including mentoring and grant programs and continuing education. One of its main activities is an annual Legal Institute, which consists of a day-long workshop on various topics of concern to law librarians. CoALL continues to play a vital role in law librarianship in the state. More information about the organization can be found at the CoAll website: http://www.aallnet.org/chapter/coall/index.htm</Bio_Org_History_Organiz._History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Cleo Spurlock Wallace, the founder and longtime director of Wallace Village for Children, was born in Garo, Colorado, on July 29, 1914. She was a distinguished teacher and humanitarian, who dreamed of developing a unique school for children with brain injuries. 
She attended primary and secondary schools in Longmont and Salida, Colorado and graduated as salutatorian from Manitou Springs High School in Manitou Springs, Colorado in 1933. In the fall of that year, she entered the University of Denver as one of the first six recipients of full four-year tuition alumni scholarships. She received her Bachelor of Arts degree in 1937. That same year, she married Thomas Wallace, an investment banker. __In 1942, Wallace received a Rockefeller Foundation Teaching Fellowship and returned to the University of Denver, where she received her master's degree in speech pathology in 1943. In December 1943, while teaching at Wheat Ridge High School, a Denver physician asked Wallace if she would provide private speech therapy to one of his young patients after school. By June, she had three children with whom she was working in the basement of her home. ''That first child back in 1943 actually started Wallace Village,'' she later stated.

With the assistance of local businessman Henry Winter, the Wallace School for Speech Therapy was incorporated as a non-profit organization at 4414 Logan Street on June 1, 1948. Wallace moved in with five teachers and thirty students. That same year, Wallace's husband died, and Wallace dedicated the rest of her life to the school.

In 1954, Wallace was able to purchase eighty-four acres of land near Broomfield, Colorado for her school. Construction of a new school began and the entire program moved to its new location by 1960. That same year, the Board of Trustees renamed the school The Wallace Village for Children.

Wallace received numerous awards and honors during her lifetime for her work with children with disabilities, including the Evans Award from the University of Denver Alumni Association and the First Citizen Award from Regis College. She also received an appointment to the White House Conference on Services for Handicapped Children in 1950 and a presidential appointment to the National Advisory Neurological Diseases and Stroke Council in 1972. 

Wallace remained Executive Director of Wallace Village until her retirement in 1974. She later moved to Sun City, Arizona, but she continued her relationship with Wallace Village as a consultant until her death on August 26, 1985. She was seventy-one years old.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Arrang_Organiz>The papers are organized into three series:;   1.  Correspondence,  1952-1970.;  2. Personal Items.;  3. Speeches, 1947-1964.;</Arrang_Organiz>
      <Bio_Org_History>Jack Foster was born in 1906 in St. Joseph, Missouri, where his father was a city editor at the Gazette. He performed odd jobs for the newspaper as a boy, and began his career with Scripps-Howard at the age of 15, writing sports articles for the Cleveland Press. When Scripps-Howard bought the Rocky Mountain News in 1926, Foster was transferred to Denver, where he worked for the News as a reporter, feature writer and book reviewer. Three years later he was transferred to the New York Telegram, where he worked as the radio editor. In 1931 he was promoted to assistant city editor. He contracted tuberculosis in 1933, and was unable to resume his career until 1937, when he became a feature writer for the New York World-Telegram. He was later promoted to assistant executive editor. __While at the New York World-Telegram he met and married Frances Magnum, who was the paper's fashion editor. In 1940 the couple moved to Denver, where Foster assumed the reins of the Rocky Mountain News as editor and chief executive officer. At that time the News faced stiff competition from its rival Denver newspaper, the Denver Post, and was in danger of losing the fight. In 1942 Foster made a bold move to save the dying paper. After convincing the president of Scripps-Howard, Roy W. Howard, of the soundness of the plan, Foster changed the format of the paper from the traditional broadside to a tabloid, magazine-style format. The new format debuted on April 13, 1942, and is largely credited with saving the dying paper. At the same time, Foster introduced another novel idea, the advice column. The Molly Mayfield column was the first advice column of its kind, pre-dating Ann Landers and Dear Abby. Foster's wife Frances penned the column under the pseudonym. Instantly popular with the airmen at Lowry Field, it soon gained a city-wide readership, followed by everyone from housewives to university professors.

Foster had a long and illustrious career at the News. He was well-regarded in the newspaper business, influential in the Denver area and well-known in political circles. He served on the American Society of Newspaper Editors' Pulitzer Prize selection panel, and kept up a lively correspondence with Dwight D. Eisenhower for a number of years. Under his guidance the News moved from a paper on the brink of closing to one with the largest circulation of any Scripps-Howard newspaper.

Foster retired from the Rocky Mountain News at the end of 1970. He died in 1978 at the age of 71, and was survived by his wife Frances, who passed away in 1998.</Bio_Org_History>
      <Bio_Org_History_Bio._Expansion>While at the New York World-Telegram he met and married Frances Magnum, who was the paper's fashion editor. In 1940 the couple moved to Denver, where Foster assumed the reins of the Rocky Mountain News as editor and chief executive officer. At that time the News faced stiff competition from its rival Denver newspaper, the Denver Post, and was in danger of losing the fight. In 1942 Foster made a bold move to save the dying paper.

      <Bio_Org_History_Biograph._History>Jack Foster was born in 1906 in St. Joseph, Missouri, where his father was a city editor at the Gazette. He performed odd jobs for the newspaper as a boy, and began his career with Scripps-Howard at the age of 15, writing sports articles for the Cleveland Press. When Scripps-Howard bought the Rocky Mountain News in 1926, Foster was transferred to Denver, where he worked for the News as a reporter, feature writer and book reviewer. Three years later he was transferred to the New York Telegram, where he worked as the radio editor. In 1931 he was promoted to assistant city editor. He contracted tuberculosis in 1933, and was unable to resume his career until 1937, when he became a feature writer for the New York World-Telegram. He was later promoted to assistant executive editor.</Bio_Org_History_Biograph._History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Claudius B. Spencer was born in 1856 in Michigan. He attended Northwestern University and Garrett Seminary, and served as a pastor of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the Detroit Conference from 1881 to 1892. He was then transferred to the Colorado Conference, where he was appointed editor of the Rocky Mountain Christian Advocate. When that publication merged with the Central Christian Advocate, Spencer moved to Kansas City, Missouri, to assume the editorship of that publication. He served in that capacity until his death in 1934.

Well regarded by his friends and colleagues, Spencer served on many denominational boards and conferences. He received an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from Lawrence University in 1896. As eulogized by University of Denver Chancellor Frederick M. Hunter, he ''generated a spirit of enthusiasm and optimism because of what he himself was, as well as because of what he did and said.'' After a short illness, Spencer died on July 14, 1934.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Leslie W. Scofield was born on May 17, 1887 to Sherman and Florence Scofield, in Denver, Colorado. He was educated in the Denver Public Schools and graduated from Manual Training High School in 1906. With encouragement from friends and relatives, he decided to further his education and so enrolled in the University of Denver. In June of 1910 he graduated from the University of Denver with a B.A. degree in History. In March of 1910, he was offered a teaching position at Warren Academy, the Preparatory School of the University, as the history and civics professor. He continued teaching until the Academy closed in 1917.

In 1911, he received his M.A. degree in History from the University of Denver. Shortly thereafter, he met his wife, Jessie Cushing, and the two were married in 1913. They had one child, Ruth, born in 1917. He returned to the University of Denver as an instructor in the fall of 1918, teaching history and plane trigonometry. After a few years he moved to teaching full time in the combined Department of History and Political Science. In 1935 he attained the rank of full professor, and the combined department was divided, with Scofield taking over the chairmanship of the History Department. He retired in 1955, and became Professor Emeritus at the University of Denver. In late 1958, Mr. Stuart Baillie, who was Director of the University of Libraries, asked Leslie Scofield to assist him in establishing archives for the University. He worked at the University of Denver’s archives from 1959 until his death in 1962.</Bio_Org_History>

The collection is arranged according to Leslie Scofield’s description taken from his autobiography:“These volumes cover the history of Colorado Seminary 1864-68, the original trustees, the early chancellorships, past University faculty and staff, University trustees, the Central City Opera House and Association, and a Miscellaneous volume.” The initial 16 volumes are indexed in the autobiography file. Each volume is housed in one file folder; volumes 1 through 18b contain two copies, each copy housed in a separate folder. File folders 17 through 28 contain additional compilations of information on the University of Denver and people associated therewith, which may have been completed after Scofield finalized his index. File folders 29 through 34 contain Scofield's personal items, including photographs, correspondence, and school notebooks.</Proc_By>

      <Bio_Org_History>Anne McKeen Shuler served as Dean of Women at the University of Denver, Denver, Colorado from 1911 until her death in 1928. Her path to that position was somewhat unique even in the days when academic credentials were less rigid than today. Shuler was born in Danville, Indiana in 1872 and was educated in the Danville Public Schools. She attended Western Seminary in Oxford, Ohio, for two years. In 1892, her older sister, the wife of Dr. Frost Craft, died leaving two young sons. Shuler abandoned her academic career to move to Lafayette, Indiana to care for her sister’s children and home.

Dr. Frost Craft was a leading Methodist minister in Indiana and Illinois. He was also a college mate and lifelong friend of Chancellor Henry A. Buchtel. Craft moved to Denver in 1901 to become pastor at Trinity Church, and Shuler moved with him to Denver. In 1911 he transferred to University Park Church, and it was then that Shuler joined the University of Denver as Dean of Women. In 1914, the University of Denver awarded her an honorary Master of Arts degree. 

Shuler never married and continued to maintain a household for Frost until his death in 1919, and during her years at the University of Denver, that home was open and welcoming to the students. Her grace and charm – the ability to make guests comfortable regardless of class or circumstances – are the qualities most often mentioned about Shuler. She was intelligent, well-read, and versed in the arts and music. She had a deep faith in God and her years presiding over a Methodist parsonage had deepened her qualities of giving of herself to all those in need. That generous spirit made her a favorite to the students she mentored as Dean of Women. 

Shuler was a member of the National Educational Association, Colorado Education Association, Administrative Women in Education, National Association of Deans of Women, and the Colorado Association of Deans of Women.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Scope-Content>The Anne McKeen Shuler papers at the University of Denver consist primarily of speeches and notes for speeches given by Shuler during her tenure as Dean of Women at the University. There is a small biography folder, a folder of correspondence, and a folder of invitations and event programs accumulated by Shuler while at the University.The balance of the collection is devoted to speeches, notes, newspaper clippings and memorabilia. Some of the speeches were given several times during the 17 years she served as Dean of Women, and the collection includes multiple versions. There are also individual pages that she added to speeches for various occasions. For many of these it is impossible to determine where they should be inserted, so they have been identified merely as fragments.</Scope-Content>

      <Bio_Org_History>Peter Hoyt Dominick was born in Stamford, Connecticut, on July 7, 1915. He was educated in public schools and graduated from St. Mark's School, Southborough, Massachusetts. He attended Yale University, where he received his A.B. in 1937, and LL.B. in 1940. After graduation he married Nancy Parks. The Dominicks had three sons and a daughter, Peter Jr., Michael, Sandy and Lynne. __During World War II, Peter Dominick served in the Army Air Corps as a pilot. His war service included flying the ''hump'' between India and China, and earned him the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal and Cluster. After the war, Dominick remained in the Air Force Reserve, reaching the rank of colonel. He maintained his private pilot's license until health concerns in the late 1960s forced him to stop flying. The flexibility afforded by his flying greatly increased the scope of both his political appearances and his speaking throughout the country.

World War II also introduced him to Colorado, when he spent time at Lowry Air Base. In 1946, the family moved to Denver, Colorado, and Dominick joined the law firm of Holland and Hart. He resigned as a partner in 1961 after being elected  to the U.S. House of Representatives. Prior to that, he was elected to the Colorado State Legislature as a Representative from Arapahoe County. After spending two years as a U.S. Representative, Dominick ran for the U.S. Senate as a Republican, and won, defeating an incumbent Democrat.

Dominick served as a U.S. Senator from Colorado from January 3, 1963 to January 2, 1975. Those years saw momentous national events such as the assassination of President Kennedy, the Vietnam War and the passage of landmark civil rights legislation. Dominick was active in the Republican Party, giving speeches at fundraising events for Republican candidates throughout the country, serving on the Republican Policy Committee, and chairing the National Republican Senatorial Committee. He was also one of nine Republican Senators to support the Kennedy Civil Rights Bill. Dominick was the ranking minority member of the Education Subcommittee of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee. He was an advocate for giving tax credits for higher education, and he was instrumental in moving the Head Start program from the Office of Economic Opportunity to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Dominick also was involved in the development of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. During his tenure in Congress he made two trips to Vietnam and Southeast Asia as a member of the Armed Services Committee. 

He was defeated for reelection in 1974, and served in 1975 as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Switzerland until failing health caused him to resign. He returned to his home in Cherry Hills, Colorado to battle multiple sclerosis. He died in Hobe Sound, Florida on March 18, 1981.</Bio_Org_History>

He resigned as a partner in 1961 after being elected  to the U.S. House of Representatives. Prior to that, he was elected to the Colorado State Legislature as a Representative from Arapahoe County. After spending two years as a U.S. Representative, Dominick ran for the U.S. Senate as a Republican, and won, defeating an incumbent Democrat.

Dominick served as a U.S. Senator from Colorado from January 3, 1963 to January 2, 1975. Those years saw momentous national events such as the assassination of President Kennedy, the Vietnam War and the passage of landmark civil rights legislation. Dominick was active in the Republican Party, giving speeches at fundraising events for Republican candidates throughout the country, serving on the Republican Policy Committee, and chairing the National Republican Senatorial Committee. He was also one of nine Republican Senators to support the Kennedy Civil Rights Bill. Dominick was the ranking minority member of the Education Subcommittee of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee. He was an advocate for giving tax credits for higher education, and he was instrumental in moving the Head Start program from the Office of Economic Opportunity to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Dominick also was involved in the development of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. During his tenure in Congress he made two trips to Vietnam and Southeast Asia as a member of the Armed Services Committee. 

He was defeated for reelection in 1974, and served in 1975 as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Switzerland until failing health caused him to resign. He returned to his home in Cherry Hills, Colorado to battle multiple sclerosis. He died in Hobe Sound, Florida on March 18, 1981.</Bio_Org_History_Bio._Expansion>

The records were transferred from the Senator's Washington office to the National Archives at the Denver Federal Center and from there to the University of Denver.  20 July 2013:  Military records donated to the University of Denver Archives from Dominick's estate by his wife Nancy P.

      <Scope-Content>The Peter H. Dominick Papers at the University of Denver primarily pertain to his years in the U. S. Senate.  Each congressional session represents a separate series. Each of these series contains material pertaining to the functions and activities performed and subjects covered during the session, filed in a set order. The order begins with Administrative and Personal information. This is followed by Political Affairs, which includes both local and national political information. Public Relations is the next category, which includes messages from colleagues and constituents, condolences and congratulations, publicity material, correspondence with friends and constituents about visits to Washington, D.C., and thank you letters. The next category is Domestic Policy, followed by Foreign Policy. These two categories were very large in the early years of Dominick's tenure in Washington, and contain policy statements on a number of issues. Unlike many senators, Dominick did not limit his correspondence to his own constituents, and thus this correspondence contains opinions and commentary from all over the United States and abroad. In the later years, this correspondence was contained mainly in other correspondence until finally, in the 1973-74 congressional term, the correspondence to Dominick was no longer saved, and only his statements on certain policies were saved as paragraphs to be added to letters on the subjects. 

These general categories are followed by Departments -- government departments, correspondence with them and with constituents who were concerned with the workings of the departments. In this category are found Constituent Agency Contacts (C.A.C.) files. These files contain requests from constituents for information or help in dealing with departments. There is a fine line between some of the C.A.C.s and Cases, but in general the C.A.C.s are items that can be handled by a letter or decision, while the Cases are more personal and contain more private information needed to work with a particular agency -- usually the military or benefits agencies. 

Agencies comprise the next category, and generally include correspondence and information similar to the Departments, but directed to specific agencies within the federal government. 
 
A small category of the State of Colorado follows, containing correspondence with the State and with constituents who want Dominick's help in influencing the State. This is followed by the District of Columbia category, which contains information about the running of the District government. This category's size varies, reflecting Dominick's involvement with the Senate oversight committee. 

The Legislation category concludes the filing system for each session. Bills and Resolutions sponsored or co-sponsored by Dominick are listed first. The legislation files contain correspondence and work files on the legislation that was being considered in a given congressional session. 

The other series in the collection cover other aspects of Dominick's work, generally divided by material type. Series 1 includes all material from Dominick's life prior to his election to Congress in 1962. Series 2 through 7 cover the congressional terms. Series 8 comprises the Record Analysis of voting during Dominick's years in Congress. Series 9 contains photographs. Series 10 covers Public Relations, which includes newsletters, press releases, and multi-media items.  Series 11 contains cases on which Dominick worked on behalf of individuals.  Series 12 contains documentation, papers, correspondence, medals, and other memorabilia related to Dominick's military career.</Scope-Content>

      <Abstract>The Higher Education Resource Services (HERS) was started in 1972 at Brown University to promote women in higher education administration, including providing assistance to women in career mapping, guidance, publishing, conference participation and other services.  HERS originally operated as a referral and placement service for women in higher education, but since 2005 has provided professional development opportunities for professional academic women and serves as a network of support for women.  HERS has three offices: HERS, Mid-America (located at the University of Denver since 1983); HERS, New England (at Wellesley College since 1976) and HERS, West (at the University of Utah).  Beginning in 1976 HERS and Bryn Mawr College have co-sponsored a Summer Institute for Women in Higher Education Administration.  Cynthia Secor has been director of the HERS Network since 1975 and is the founding Director of the Summer Institute for Women in Higher Education Administration and HERS, Mid-America.</Abstract>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __In the early 1970s a small group of senior-level women from New England campuses met to discuss the lack of career opportunities for academic women. They discussed mutual interests, calling themselves ''Committee for the Concerns of Women in New England College and Universities'' (the Concerns Committee). This Committee drafted a proposal to create a referral service for women with appropriate qualifications for faculty and administrative jobs. In 1972 they received a modest grant from the Ford Foundation to create Project HERS (Higher Education Resource Services) at Brown University, which offered referral and placement services, career counseling workshops, and administrative training seminars. The Project had a dual mission – to improve the opportunities and status of academic professional women and to aid colleges and universities in compliance with the requirements of Title IX (of the Education Amendments of 1972) that mandated an end to discrimination based on gender in employment. __In 1976 Project HERS moved from Brown University to Wellesley College, again with support from the Ford Foundation. HERS, New England responded to the needs of women in the job market; they sponsored career counseling workshops and started the Management Institute for Women in Higher Education at Wellesley College. The Management Institute, originally supported by the Fund for the Improvement for Post-Secondary Education, is a series of five weekend seminars focused on teaching administrative skills. 

Project HERS was so successful that the Ford Foundation granted further funding to establish HERS, Mid-Atlantic at the University of Pennsylvania in 1974 as a separate administrative unit. It was conceived of as a sister organization that would move beyond the referral function to offer an increasing range of services. In 1975, Director Cynthia Secor proposed a residential program co-sponsored with Bryn Mawr College to offer appropriate administrative training for women seeking advancement in higher education. The Summer Institute for Women in Higher Education Administration started in 1976 and was initially funded by a three-year grant from the William H. Donner Foundation. By 1978, the Institute was self supporting and continues to enroll participants, over 2,100 by 2005. 

HERS, West was started at the University of Utah in 1979 for professional women in intermountain states, again with funding from the Ford Foundation. 

In 1983, HERS, Mid-Atlantic relocated from the University of Pennsylvania to the University of Denver and was renamed HERS, Mid-America.

In addition to the Summer Institute and Management Institute, HERS has developed new programs. In the 1990s HERS and the National Associate of Collegiate Women and Athletic Administrators (NACWAA) teamed up to cosponsor the Institute for Administrative Advancement (IAA). The IAA offers week long seminars for women coaches and athletic administrators, including intensive training in athletic administration. The HERS-South Africa Seminar also started in the late 1990s. It was funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and allowed over seventy South African women to travel to the United States and participate in trainings for women in higher education administration. The HERS-South Africa office is located in Cape Town and it continues to offer workshops as well as a week-long HERS-South Africa Academy.

 HERS, Mid-America is housed at the University of Denver in the University’s  Merle C. Chambers Center for Women building.

All of the offices in the HERS network are involved in other activities to promote women, particularly women in higher education administration. These include working with women on career mapping and guidance; collaboration with other organizations, colleges and universities; attending and presenting in conferences; publishing; and service on various education related boards and commissions.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Born In 1906 at Joplin, Missouri, Alonso B. May earned his academic degrees at Kansas State Teachers College, the University of Kansas and the University of Iowa. Students at Graceland College in Iowa and Simmons College in Boston shared in his knowledge before he accepted his long term appointment at the University of Denver, Denver, Colorado. In World War II he served as Personnel Officer on the staff of the Commander of the 7th Amphibious Force in the Pacific and as an Instructor at the U. S. Naval Academy at Annapolis. Returning to Denver he continued his military affiliation by being instrumental in the formation of a Selective Service Reserve Unit and was retired as a Commander in 1966. 

The 31 years of May’s service at the University of Denver included the chairmanship of the Department of Economics and the Division of Social Sciences in the College of Arts and Sciences, and the Division of Economics and Statistics in the College of Business Administration. He was Coordinator of the Department of Transportation and most recently Head of the Division of Administrative Environment in the College of Business Administration. He directed the Teaching Institute of Economics, with seminars and a working library, supported through a grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. He participated in the founding of several Colorado financial institutions and served as a consultant and on boards of directors. Members of the University Senate honored him by his election as President, and he was chairman of several of their committees. His sincere social interests and enthusiasm were evidenced by memberships and participation in the University Park Methodist Church, Royal Economics Society of England, American Economic Association, American Institute of Management and the Denver County and Colorado State Republican Assemblies. 

An avid reader of books and journals, ''Al'' delighted in quotations that stimulated thought and challenged both his colleagues and his students. On appropriate occasions he cited an author, ''Sarter Resertus,'' who was discovered to be a pen name for his wisdom that grew from varied experiences. A successful fisherman, he loved the few opportunities he had to work a stream or a lake with his colleagues. 

These are only a few of the accomplishments and memories of a full life that we now formally recognize in a moment of silence at our closing faculty meeting. We record them in our minds and in a letter of sympathy to his beloved wife and companion, Beulah May. ''Al'' is gone from our sight but memories of happiness and success will endure. 

[The tribute above was presented at the June 1968, meeting of the faculty of the University of Denver College of Business Administration.]

      <Bio_Org_History>Chester M. Alter was born in 1906 in rural Indiana.  He received a B.S. from Ball State University, an M.A. from Indiana University, and a Ph.D. in chemistry from Harvard University in 1936.  During World War II, he was recruited from his job at Boston University to work on the Manhattan Project.  Alter served as Chancellor of the University of Denver for 14 years, from 1953 until 1967, the second longest tenure of a chancellor at DU. After leaving DU in 1967, he continued to be associated with the University as Chancellor Emeritus.  He also served as a trustee in such organizations as the Gates Foundation, Central City Opera Association, the YMCA, and as the sole trustee for the George W. Clayton Trust.  He has been on the board of directors of almost every educational institution in the Front Range, and has served as consultant to institutions of higher education in Korea, Malaysia and Brazil.  He was a section and a division chairman of the American Chemical Society and was a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

His influence has been felt throughout the State of Colorado in such organizations as the Colorado Board of Ethics, the Colorado Commission on the Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution, the Colorado Expenditures Council, and the Judicial Advisory Council of the Colorado Supreme Court. He was the first non-lawyer to be an officer of the American Judicature Society, and was honored by its Justice Award in 1980.  

During his tenure at the University of Denver, he oversaw the transformation of the University from a local institution to an internationally known one.  He raised faculty salaries and was instrumental in bringing in outstanding scholars as visiting professors, such as Arnold Toynbee, and speakers such as U Thant and Averill Harriman.  He also increased the volume of sponsored research at the University.  He saw the University campus expand from 75 to 125 acres, and was responsible for many construction projects, including residence halls, a Law Center, and a science and engineering center.  The Chester M. Alter Arboretum at the University of Denver recognizes his work in maintaining the character of the campus.

Alter was married to Arvilla Morrison in 1933.  They have one son, Richard David Alter, born in 1939. Until her death in 1997, Arvilla Alter was involved in her husband’s work in education. After his wife's death, Alter continued to be involved with the University of Denver and the community. Chester Alter passed away in 2006.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __Helen Bonfils has a rich legacy in Denver, Colorado. She became famous for her philanthropy to benefit the arts, culture and animals. Her father was Frederick Gilmer Bonfils, the co-founder and editor of the Denver Post. Helen would later take over as the owner of the Denver Post.  She built the Bonfils Theatre, on East Colfax Avenue at Elizabeth Street  in 1953  to the cost of $1.25 million.  The theatre was built to try to preserve  live theater in a time when Hollywood Films were taking over the entertainment industry. The Bonfils served as a multipurpose theater; presenting plays, operas, movies, concerts, lectures and television productions. In the 1960’s the Denver Center for the Performing Arts (DCPA) opened downtown.  In 1985 the theatre was renamed the Lowenstein Theatre and was then closed in 1986 by its umbrella organization, the Denver Center for the Performing Arts. The theater is now a retail center, anchored by the Tattered Cover Bookstore.</Bio_Org_History>

The theatre was built to try to preserve  live theater in a time when Hollywood Films were taking over the entertainment industry. The Bonfils served as a multipurpose theater; presenting plays, operas, movies, concerts, lectures and television productions. In the 1960’s the Denver Center for the Performing Arts (DCPA) opened downtown.  In 1985 the theatre was renamed the Lowenstein Theatre and was then closed in 1986 by its umbrella organization, the Denver Center for the Performing Arts. The theater is now a retail center, anchored by the Tattered Cover Bookstore.</Bio_Org_History_Organiz._History>

Carey came to the University of Denver in 1945. He served as chairman of the University's history department from 1945 to 1958, and was on the faculty until his retirement in 1971. Carey's field of interest was modern European history, with special emphasis on French history, the French Revolution, the Napoleonic era, and English history of the 16th and 17th centuries. Closer to home, he studied the Sand Creek Massacre, which took place in Colorado in 1864. Upon his retirement, he was named Professor Emeritus. 

Carey died on November 25, 1972. Two scholarships for history majors, the Raymond G. Carey Memorial Scholarships, were endowed in his memory.</Bio_Org_History_Biograph._History>

      <Abstract>The Central City Opera Association is a non-profit organization founded in 1931 to manage and preserve the Central City Opera House located in Central City, Colorado and to direct annual summer opera festivals.  Heirs of Peter McFarlane, a Central City businessman who owned the Opera House prior to 1931, donated the building to the University of Denver in 1931. The real estate holdings of the University of Denver were transferred back to the Association in 1982. The Association held the Central City Play Festival from 1932-1942 and from 1946-1970.  Performances included the premieres of ''The Ballad of Baby Doe''(1956) and ''Lady From Colorado''(1964).  The Opera House, Teller House and other Central City properties are part of the organization, and the Central City Opera Festival commissioned five original operas. 

The records located at the University of Denver cover the period from 1931 to 1977.  The collection contains the administrative records of the organization together with programs for performances and photographs of productions and artists.</Abstract>

This collection was listed in Special Collections records as three separate collections:  Central City Opera House Association Collection, Central City Opera Association Collection and Central City collection in the University records.  Research indicated that the proper titling of the collection is Central City Opera House Association, which is the entity created in 1931 to host operas and manage the property, and is still in existence.  Any University records are part of other record groups, i.e., Trustees minutes, Real Estate records, Chancellors' papers, etc.  So instead of three collections there is only one.  There is a finding aid to what are called the "public relations/publicity" records.  There is no indication as to which boxes are associated with this processing.  The other partially processed piece of the collection is 94 document boxes.  They contain programs and photographs of performances and performers, together with Anne Evans' diary.  An inventory of those boxes is in the reading room and also in "Collection Guides" in the Special Collections G drive.</Accruals>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The Central City Opera House opened in 1878 when Central City, Colorado was a thriving community of almost 3,000 people. Soon after, the fortunes of Central City declined while those of Denver, Colorado rose.  In 1881 the Opera House was rescued from demolition by the Gilpin County Opera House Association.  As the population of Central City declined, the House was allowed to deteriorate until a local businessman, Peter McFarlane, took it over, paid for repairs and supported it through several seasons of financial loss.  In 1910 moving pictures were shown, but it was not enough to save the theater, and in 1927, McFarlane closed the Opera House. __In 1931, Ida Kruse McFarlane, who was a professor of English at the University of Denver, decided to try to rescue the Opera House from destruction.  She enlisted the help of Anne Evans, daughter of the second territorial governor and a member of the University of Denver’s Civic Theater.  They first determined that the Opera House was structurally sound, and then approached the University of Denver with the possibility of the University accepting title to the Opera House.  The plan would take advantage of the tax-exempt status of the University and its connection to the Civic Theater.  The University agreed to accept the gift from the McFarlane family, but stipulated that the University would have no responsibility for the upkeep of the property or its use as a theater.  Those responsibilities fell to a group composed of Anne Evans, Ida Kruse McFarlane, Allen True, Edna James Chappell and Delos Chappell, who in 1931 formed the Central City Opera House Association.  

The Opera House was renovated, funds were raised, and on July 16, 1932, the first production was presented.  Opening ceremonies included Frederick McFarlane handing the Opera House key to Frederick M. Hunter, Chancellor of the University of Denver. The opening production was Camille and starred Lillian Gish.  Robert Edmond Jones designed and produced Camille along with several other early productions.  It was the beginning of a long run of summer opera seasons that grew to include Denver débutantes as flower girls.  Many important singers appeared in Central City productions, including Beverly Sills.  Central City Opera House Association commissioned five original operas:  The Ballad of Baby Doe, Gabriel’s Daughter:  The Story of Clara Brown, The Face on the Barroom Floor, Lady from Colorado and En Mis Palabras. 

The Association held the Central City Play Festival from 1932-1942 and from 1946-1970.  Performances included the premieres of ''The Ballad of Baby Doe''(1956) and ''Lady From Colorado''(1964).  The Festival was suspended from 1942-1945. 

The Central City Opera House Association’s affiliation to the University of Denver continued for many years.  In addition to the Opera House itself, the University owned many other properties in Central City that were donated to the University.  Other properties were donated to the Association directly.  In 1953 the Teller House was transferred from the University to the Association in order to relieve the University of building ownership in which liquor was sold.  At the same time, an agreement was completed between the two entities whereby the Association would manage all the properties on the University’s behalf.  That arrangement continued with minor modifications until 1982.  The Central City Opera House Association was in one of its periodic financial downturns and requested that the University transfer some of their properties to the Association so that they could be sold to fund the upkeep and renovation of other important properties.  An agreement was reached and the real estate holdings of the University of Denver that were located in Central City were transferred to the Association in 1982.  

The Association has continued to prosper and holds a summer opera season.  In 2010, the general/artistic director is Pelham G. ''Pat'' Pearce, who continues the tradition of training young voices and presenting unique and important operas.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Mary Coyle Chase was born February 25,1907 in Denver, Colorado to Mary (McDonough) Coyle and Frank Bernard, a salesman. She graduated from high school at age 15 and studied at both the University of Denver and the University of Colorado before working for 14 years at the Rocky Mountain News. She received an honorary Doctorate of Literature from the University of Denver in 1947. She married a fellow reporter, Robert L. Chase, on June 7, 1928 and shortly thereafter was fired from her job as a result of a prank she played on her boss. She was reinstated but chose to leave to raise a family. She had three sons and lived in Denver at 532 W. Fourth Avenue, now an historic home. She died in 1981. __Inspiration for the play Harvey came from an encounter with an acquaintance during World War II. According to Chase, ''she was a woman who had worked for years to send her only son through college. The day I looked at her, her boy had been dead about two months, killed in action in the Pacific. I asked myself a question: Could I ever possibly write anything that might make that woman laugh again?'' One night Chase dreamed about a psychiatrist being chased by a giant white rabbit. Her four Irish uncles had told her stories of pookas, mischievous goblins or spectors held in Irish folklore to appear only to those who believe. The play took Chase two years to write, in the evenings when her children were in bed and her husband was at his job. She rewrote Harvey 50 times, trying it out on family, friends, and her cleaning lady before sending it to New York producer Brock Pemberton. He called her up a few nights later while she was reading a bedtime story to her boys to offer to produce the play. 

Harvey opened on Broadway to rave reviews and played there for four and a half years, making it one of the five longest running Broadway plays. The success of her play did not go to Chase's head; the morning after the opening, she returned to her home in Denver, retrieved her children from friends, and began cleaning house and doing laundry. She had difficulty finishing her chores, however, because of the thousands of glowing phone calls and letters she received. Happily, her original question was answered when the woman whose son had died told her she had seen the play and had laughed. ''And strangely,'' wrote Chase, ''I got letters from many other parents from all over the country, people who had lost sons in the war. They all told me Harvey had brought them their first real laugh in months.''</Bio_Org_History>

They all told me Harvey had brought them their first real laugh in months.''</Bio_Org_History_Bio._Expansion>
      <Bio_Org_History_Biograph._History>Mary Coyle Chase was born February 25,1907 in Denver, Colorado to Mary (McDonough) Coyle and Frank Bernard, a salesman.

      <Bio_Org_History>Born in Gibbon, Nebraska on November 1, 1885, Benjamin Mark Cherrington was raised as a 'Son of the West' living in Council Bluffs, Iowa, as well as Lincoln, Nebraska and then Omaha, Nebraska.  He attended Nebraska Wesleyan University for one year from 1904 to 1905.  He placed a hold on continuing his education by accepting a position with the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) in Adrian, Michigan from 1905 to 1907.  But he resumed his education at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln until his graduation with a Bachelor of Arts in 1911. He continued his work experience in education as a high school teacher and coach in Omaha. Upon graduation, Cherrington continued to graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley until 1917.  While there, he retained his relationship with the YMCA by acting as secretary for the state chapter.  In 1919 he served as the Executive Secretary of the Denver Student chapter of the YMCA.  On June 28, 1924 he married Edith Harper and raised two children, Anne Mary and Benjamin Mark, Jr.  Cherrington earned five academic degrees: an A.B. from the University of Nebraska in 1911, an A.M. from the University of California in 1922, a Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1934, an L.L.D. from the University of Nebraska in 1934 and a Doctor of Public Service from the University of Denver in 1953. __During this time he also began his long term career with the University of Denver as an instructor in 1926.  He was named Director of the University of Denver Graduate School of International Studies, Chair of the Graduate School. In 1943 he was appointed acting chancellor of the University while Chancellor Caleb Gates was fulfilling his military duties in World War II. Cherrington served in that post until February 1946.   During his term of office as chancellor, he added the School of Speech, Department of Theatre, and the Hotel and Restaurant Management School to the University's programs. He taught at the University until 1951. Cherrington also founded the Social Science Foundation at the University and maintained his association with that organization until 1943. 

His work in international relations began in 1938 when Cherrington accepted the task of organizing the work of the newly-created Division of Cultural Relations in the U.S. Department of State at the invitation of Secretary of State Cordell Hull and President Franklin D. Roosevelt. This work continued with the United Nations when he was involved with the U.N. San Francisco Convention in 1944.  In addition to his work in education, Cherrington was an author of the United Nations Charter and a co-founder of the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). He continued his work with the U.N. through UNESCO after World War II.  He worked at UNESCO for six years developing its commission and temporarily presiding as chair until Milton Eisenhower took over. Cherrington then became vice-chair.  His work in international relations and universal consciousness through education resumed with the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, which provided colleges and universities opportunities to establish cultural relations and international affairs programs for their students and faculties.  Cherrington was a trustee for 36 years.  He also worked with the Rotary Club of Denver and Rotary International at this time until 1950.  He was honored by Queen Elizabeth in 1956 for his contributions to international affairs. Cherrington retired in 1969 and remained in Denver until his death on May 2, 1980.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Scope-Content>The Ben Mark Cherrington papers, deposited with the University of Denver Archives, span the years 1911 to 1952. The papers center around the interwoven themes of higher education and cultural relations. Cherrington’s goals and those of the organizations he served are illustrated in the papers. His major goal was to create social change and world consciousness through education. The papers include general professional correspondence, administrative and official records, conference addresses, publications, images, recordings, lecture notes, course outlines and official memorabilia related to his work with the University of Denver, the YMCA, the Social Science Foundation, the League of Nations, the National Education Association, the US Department of State, Division of Cultural Relations, the UN, UNESCO, the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, Rotary International and the Rotary Club of Denver, as well as related to his personal life and education.

The National Student YMCA papers cover the years 1911 to 1926.  These papers cover national programs and Rocky Mountain regional programs during the time Cherrington served as secretary.  The collection also houses records related to Cherrington’s travel to Europe in 1921 and again in 1926 related to his coordination of seminars for government leaders.  The University of Denver series from 1926 to 1951 covers his work with the Graduate School of International Studies, his chairmanship of the Graduate School and the Social Science Foundation and his Chancellorship during World War II.  Courses which Cherrington taught at the University of Denver are arranged chronologically and contain course outlines and lecture notes. The collection also contains materials related to his work with the National Education Association from 1940 to 1946 and other education initiatives such as conferences and seminars. Cherrington’s papers surrounding his involvement with international affairs begin with the League of Nations from 1930 to 1938. These papers include correspondence, background materials and reports related to the New York, Chicago, and Colorado offices. Those papers related to the U.S. Department of State’s Division of Cultural Relations, the United Nations and UNESCO record his role in international affairs during and following World War II.  Dated from 1936 to 1951, these comprise the majority of the collection.  His international work is also reflected in papers dated later in his career with the Carnegie Endowment for Peace, Executive Committee and the Rotary Club of Denver and Rotary International.  There are other Miscellaneous Organizational records related to regional and national education and international relations and Governmental records.</Scope-Content>

These women worked with organizations such as the American Red Cross, Army Special Services, the USO, CIA, USMD, and the United States State Department in direct support of U.S. soldiers and allies in Vietnam. Established in 1996, the idea for the collection came about after Jolynne Strang and Cathleen Cordova, both of whom served in Vietnam, gathered information on civilian women who had lost their lives during that conflict. Strang and Cordova also organized a national ceremony to recognize all women who had served as civilians in Vietnam and to honor those women who had died. The first ceremony was held on November 10, 1993 at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, 'The Wall,' in Washington, D.C.

Between March 1973, when most U.S. soldiers left Vietnam as the result of the Paris Peace Accords, and April 1975, Sally Vinyard was the housing chief for the U.S. Defense Attache Office. She played a crucial role in evacuating more than 25,000 South Vietnamese and Americans as Communist troops advanced on Saigon</Bio_Org_History>

Established in 1996, the idea for the collection came about after Jolynne Strang and Cathleen Cordova, both of whom served in Vietnam, gathered information on civilian women who had lost their lives during that conflict. Strang and Cordova also organized a national ceremony to recognize all women who had served as civilians in Vietnam and to honor those women who had died. The first ceremony was held on November 10, 1993 at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, 'The Wall,' in Washington, D.C.

Between March 1973, when most U.S. soldiers left Vietnam as the result of the Paris Peace Accords, and April 1975, Sally Vinyard was the housing chief for the U.S. Defense Attache Office. She played a crucial role in evacuating more than 25,000 South Vietnamese and Americans as Communist troops advanced on Saigon</Bio_Org_History_Organiz._History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The idea of a woman’s college in Denver was the brainchild of Dr. Robert Cameron, a Baptist minister from Canada who was the pastor of the First Baptist Church of Denver.   From 1887 to 1888, meetings were held and plans made for a women's college for the Western United States.  In April 1888, 20 acres of Montrose was designated for a ''female college of high order.''  A constitution was adopted October 22, 1888, which provided that the name would be ''The Colorado Woman’s College Society.''  The first Board of Trustees was elected in November 1888, comprised of 22 men and five women, and a Certificate of Incorporation for Colorado Woman’s College was presented to Arapahoe County, Colorado on November 14, 1888. __As in many such enterprises, the college was impeded by lack of financial support, and it was March 25, 1890 before the cornerstone for the Administration Building, later named Treat Hall, was laid.  Money problems continued to plague the founders of the college, and it was not until 1908 that a President, Jay Porter Treat, was elected.  The first students arrived in September 1909, and the first commencement was June 6, 1911.  

The school experienced periods of growth as well as financial setbacks in the early years.  In 1926 Samuel Jesse Vaughan was elected the fourth president of Colorado Woman’s College and the college began an aggressive fund-raising campaign to expand the college and add dormitory space.  Foote Hall, named after Ira A. Foote who until his death had been an ardent supporter of the college, was authorized in 1930.  During Dr. Vaughan’s tenure enrollment increased from 93 to 236.  The strict social code of the college was relaxed to allow a gala carnival, but not enough to allow smoking or dancing. The tradition of 'The Hanging of the Christmas Greens' began in 1930.  It received its accreditation from the Higher Learning Commission as Colorado Woman's College in 1932. College president Samuel Vaughan also began the library, which boasted 3,000 volumes in 1928 and 6,000 by 1933.  

The next president, James Edwin Hutchingson, served from 1933 until 1950.  He was well acquainted with the college, having been on the Board of Trustees since 1923.  The depression years were survived by creative measures such as exchanging tuition, housing and meals for farm produce or labor.  Although the depression affected the college’s fundraising adversely, the student body was steadily increasing until it reached 360 in the 1939-1940 academic year.  The completion of Porter Hall, an additional dormitory, was accomplished in 1939. 

The post-World War II boom also hit the college.  Enrollment, which had been 397 in 1943 increased to 507 for the 1949-1950 year. The building required to support the increased student body was also undertaken, with a dormitory, Pulliam Hall, and Dora Porter Mason Hall, which housed the dining hall, gymnasium and swimming pool, were completed in 1947. By fall 1956, when Curtis Hall opened as a dormitory, enrollment was 531.  At the same time a new science building, Hutchingson Hall, was started.  Expansion continued with the addition of Whatley Chapel in 1962, and the Permelia Curtis Porter Library in 1963.  

The expansion also extended to academics.  In 1963 a program was established in Vienna, Austria to allow students to study abroad for a year.  A year later a program was established in Madrid, Spain and in 1966 one was started in Geneva, Switzerland.  The early 1960s also saw the construction of two additional dormitories, Dutton Hall and Dunklee Hall.  In 1965, Mrs. W. Ida Houston donated assets to help construct a fine arts center on the campus, which was named the W. Dale and W. Ida Houston Fine Arts Center.  

In 1966, the college was offered what seemed to be the answer to all its financial dreams.  Temple Buell, a Denver architect and philanthropist, offered to endow the college with a trust worth an estimated $25,000,000 in return for changing the name of the college to Temple Buell College.  The agreement did not provide any cash to the college, only income from the trust that could be used to pay off mortgages and other obligations.  Upon Buell’s death the trust money would become available to the college.  The trustees agreed and on July 1, 1967, Colorado Woman’s College became Temple Buell College.  

Another addition to the college was the gift of Mr. and Mrs. Edward O. Stoddard for a medical building.  With additional financial support from John Nelson Meade, the center broke ground in 1970 as the Loa M. Stoddard Student Health Center and John N. Meade Hospital and Medical Services.  

The tide of history was turning against women’s colleges, however, and enrollment began a steady decline after 1967, when it peaked at 1117.  The name change to Temple Buell College had caused many of the former donors to the college to assume that their contributions were no longer needed.  Also, the name change had not helped with recruitment.  Colorado Woman’s College was well known throughout the country.  Temple Buell College was not.  Finally financial reality forced the trustees to resolve to change the name of the college back to a form of its previous name, even if it meant giving up the Buell trust.  It was formally resolved March 29, 1973 that the college would be known as Colorado Women’s College (woman became plural and changed to women).  

The new name that was supposed to bring with it more community financial support, did not relieve the problems of the college.  Finances were desperate even with gifts from the Boettcher, Gates and El Pomar foundations.  In 1976 a proposal was made to make the college a component of the University of Denver, but was rejected by the trustees.  In an attempt to revitalize the college, a $7,000,000 fundraising campaign was initiated and Marjorie Bell Chambers was elected president on May 19, 1976.  Dropping enrollment, coupled with questions as to the financial viability of the college, caused major donors to discontinue support.  The decision was made not to reopen in January 1977.  That caused a flurry of action as alumnae and friends scrambled to raise funds.  By January 3, 1997, the day the school was to close, $500,000 in cash and pledges had been raised and the trustees were persuaded to keep the school open.  

New programs such as a re-engagement program intended to attract women who had interrupted their academic careers and were ready to resume their education in order to prosper in the corporate world.  There was also discord, as President Chambers left the college after only a year, and was replaced by Sherry Manning.  Manning began a program of weekend college that allowed women to obtain a bachelor's degree by going to school on weekends.  The first registration, in March 1980 enrolled 127 students.  It was not enough.  By the end of 1980 the college could not afford to continue operating.  The situation was exacerbated by a dispute with the faculty over raises and tenure.  Added to that was the threat that the North Central Association would withhold accreditation due to the financial situation.  So, on April 30, 1981, it was resolved that Colorado Women’s College and the University of Denver, a private university, would explore affiliation of the two institutions.  On November 22, 1981 the Board of Trustees accepted an offer from the University of Denver to acquire the assets of Colorado Women’s College.  The agreement was formally signed February 2, 1982, and Colorado Women’s College ceased to exist as an independent college.  It merged with the University of Denver that opened the Women's College of the University of Denver.  The campus, located in northeast Denver, housed the Women's College until 2001, when the campus was purchased by Johnson &amp; Wales University.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Proc_By>__ __The records are stored in several locations and need to be gathered together before processing.  CWC photos have been inventoried and foldered. A preliminary inventory of the material in what was called the President's papers was made during the Archives Institute in 1977.  Why DU had this information at that time is not known, but the inventory makes clear that college records and president's papers were not separate.  Currently we have the college records plus president papers for Hutchingson, Dawson, Chambers, etc.  Need to decide if those should be part of CWC records of individual collections.   Audio and film material is both at Mary Reed and in Penrose electronic shelving and should be consolidated. (mak 1/3/2008)</Proc_By>

      <Bio_Org_History>Burton Edward Feldman was born on May 3, 1926 in Albany, New York. He spent much of his early life in Troy, N.Y. and graduated from high school before enlisting in the Army in 1945.  Feldman served in the military for three years, spending much of his time in the service stationed in the Philippines.  Feldman achieved the rank of Second Lieutenant while serving as a Field Artillery Commander.  Feldman then attended Union College in Schenectady, N.Y. where he received his B.A. in 1949. Feldman received his M.A. in English from Columbia University in 1954.  While working on his master's degree at Columbia University, Burton married Margaret (Peggy) Mary Gildea in 1953. Feldman worked for a brief period in 1956 for United Productions of America. Feldman helped with writing episodes of Gerald McBoing Boing, and was also employed to conduct research on storylines in the public domain that could potentially be adopted into cartoons. Feldman then moved on to the University of Chicago to both teach and work on his Ph.D., which he received in 1965. __Feldman was a lecturer in both literature and philosophy at the University of Chicago from 1957 - 1962.  During his time in Chicago, Feldman studied under Leo Strauss, a political philosophy professor, and became friends with Mircea Eliade, a Romanian author and scholar of religion.  After leaving the University of Chicago, Feldman and his wife spent two years in Europe and Turkey teaching for the University of Maryland. After returning to the U.S., Feldman arrived at the University of Denver in 1965. During his time at the University, Feldman acted as Director of Undergraduate Honors in English (1968 - 1974), Editor of the Denver Quarterly (1970 - 1975), and Director of Graduate Studies in English (1980 - 1984).  While teaching at the University of Denver, Feldman undertook his professional scholarship in earnest. Working with Professor Robert D. Richardson, Jr., Feldman published ''The Rise of Modern Mythology: 1680 - 1860'' in 1972. The book explored the use of myth in the western world and how it was used in literature and society from 1680-1860. Richardson and Feldman continued to work together from 1979 - 1984, and published a 50 volume compendium of rare and important mythological texts used by Romantic poets. The anthology is entitled ''Myth and Romanticism.''  In 2000, Feldman published a history of the Nobel Prizes entitled ''The Nobel Prize: A History of Genius, Controversy, and Prestige.'' The book is a comprehensive study of the Prizes themselves, the process behind their awarding, and what each one has represented socially throughout its existence.  Feldman worked on several scholarly projects that never saw publication.  A book tentatively entitled ''Fame and Glory'' explored the idea of notoriety and the seeking of recognition in literary figures, both authors and characters. Feldman also wanted to write a sequel to ''The Rise of Modern Mythology: 1680 - 1860'' that would update it to modern day, but the project was never completed or published.  Feldman was also a poet, amateur novelist, and an artist. Feldman had his poetry published in a number of different journals over the course of his life. Feldman made efforts to publish a book of poetry, but was unsuccessful.  Feldman was also unsuccessful in getting any of his several novels published. Feldman never made any professional attempts at drawing, but maintained it as a hobby throughout his life.  Feldman maintained friendships with many literary figures. Both Feldman and his wife regularly corresponded with both Rikki Ducornet and David Markson, two modernist authors.The Feldmans also kept in close contact with Mircea Eliade and his wife Christinel. Burton Feldman also struck up a friendship and corresponded for a time with Roald Hoffman, the winner of the 1981 Nobel Prize for Chemistry.  Feldman retired from the University of Denver in 1998 and died from cancer in Denver, Colorado on January 10, 2003. At the time of his death, Burton Feldman had been working on a book that was part fact and part historical fiction that chronicled the friendship of Albert Einstein, Wolfgang Pauli, Bertrand Russell, and Kurt Godel in their declining years.  Feldman had tentatively entitled the work ''Einstein and Friends.''  The book was finished and published in 2007 under the supervision of Peggy Feldman and Katherine Williams with the title ''112 Mercer St.: Einstein, Russell, Godel, Pauli, and the End of Innocence in Science.''</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Lewis Dusenberry Gilbert was born in Palo Alto, Calif. He inherited sufficient wealth from his parents and grandparents to make him financially independent. He worked briefly as a reporter for weekly newspapers in the New York metropolitan area. In 1933, he went to his first annual meeting at the Consolidated Gas Company, which later became part of Consolidated Edison.

Mr. Gilbert undertook a crusade to make corporate executives more responsive to the stockholders who owned their corporations. Despite being cold-shouldered by many managements and hissed by some other shareholders, he continued to appear regularly at annual meetings to voice his views.  He and his brother, John J. Gilbert, lived on their dividends and were very interested in the management of the companies that supplies their livelihood.  

Gilbert was an army corporal in World War II.  One of his successes was to challenge Generals Douglas MacArthur and Lucius Clay for serving as directors of corporations in which they owned no stock.  Both Generals subsequently purchased stock.  

The annual report of activities by stockholders at annual meetings, issued by Lewis D. and John J. Gilbert, Corporate Democracy Inc., was published until 1979. Lewis Gilbert also wrote a book about corporate democracy, ''Dividends and Democracy,'' in 1956.

      <Bio_Org_History>A tireless fundraiser and advocate of higher education, Marion S. Gottesfeld (1917-2001) became known as the ''godmother'' of the University of Denver. She was born Marion Rosenbaum in Brooklyn, New York and was educated at Wellesley College, where she received a bachelor’s degree in geology (with minors in physics and chemistry) in 1938. After earning a master’s degree in business administration at New York University in 1941, she married Denver Rose Medical Center founder and president, Dr. M. Ray Gottesfeld, a widower with two young sons (Stuart and Kenneth). The couple subsequently had two more children. Dr. Gottesfeld died in 1961. Marion later married Denver businessman, David Hurwitz. __Marion Gottesfeld’s association with the University of Denver began soon after her arrival in Colorado in the late 1940s. She was appointed to the University of Denver’s Board of Trustees in 1953, and at the time of her death in 2001, her tenure was the longest of any University trustee – 48 years of service. Her many contributions to the University include the formation of the Women’s Library Association, which has raised over three million dollars in funds for the University’s Penrose Library. She also helped to establish the University’s Center for Judaic Studies, Holocaust Awareness Institute, and Lamont Music Associates. 

As a commissioner of the Denver Urban Renewal Authority, Marion Gottesfeld was involved in the redevelopment of lower downtown Denver and was instrumental in the restoration and preservation of Larimer Square and the Daniels and Fisher Tower. She also served on the Board of Directors of KDBI, a Denver PBS affiliate. She was an active and successful fund raiser for a myriad of organizations including Denver’s Rose Medical Center, Colorado Head Start, Opera Colorado, and the Colorado Symphony. In 1999, she was appointed by Colorado Governor Bill Owens to the State’s Commission on Higher Education.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Harry A. Huffman was born July 13, 1883 in Raton, New Mexico.  The family moved to Denver, Colorado in 1892.  His father was a physician and wanted Harry to follow that path, so Harry became a licensed pharmacist in 1906.  That same year he married Christine Keehn.  He opened a drug store on Colfax Avenue.  In 1912 during a visit to a local theater he noticed that when people left the theater they went to the corner drug store for a soda.  He opened his first theater next to his drug store in 1912, the Bide-A-Wee theater to provide a ready market for the drug store sodas.  In 1922, he purchased the Thompson, which is now the Bluebird Theater. In 1926, he built the Aladdin Theater.  Huffman ran the theaters until 1937 when he contracted them to Fox-Intermountain Theaters.

In 1949 Huffman formed Aladdin Radio and Television, Inc..  He then bought KLZ radio and obtained a license to provide television.  KLZ-TV went on the air in 1953.  

Huffman was a director of American National Bank and a founder of the Denver Convention and Visitors Bureau.  He was the Bureau's president for 13 years.  He was also a member of Rotary International, Denver Country Club and the Mile High Club.  

Huffman also build the 13-room mansion at 13 Leetsdale Drive known as Shangri-La, which was built as a duplicate of the monastery in the movie ''Lost Horizons.''  

In his later years, he developed glaucoma and was virtually blind.  He died July 8, 1969.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Scope-Content>In 1962, Gerard E. Mayer began working on his master's thesis on the history of the University of Denver, 1920 to 1940. In addition to the traditional sources of the university archives, newspapers and yearbooks, Mayer surveyed approximately 200 alumni who studied at the University from 1920 to 1940 asking for their opinions on school spirit, relations between the students and faculty, and the lasting influence of faculty. He received 35 responses, which constitute this collection. 

The letters vary greatly, as did the experiences of the students during their time at the University. Whether the respondent was an on-campus student or a day student affected their experience. The Great Depression had a serious impact on both students and the University during those years. Professors and chancellors were mentioned as having influence on both DU and the students. Several of the letters mention Ben Cherrington and the Social Science Foundation as adding an element of international interest to the campus. The letters are a source of information on the student experience during the 1920's and 1930's.</Scope-Content>

Mazzulla and his wife, Jo, published several small history booklets that were sold in tourist shops.  He collected images of the Old West including photographs of the women who worked in bawdyhouses and executions. His historical work was controversial, and he is quoted as saying:  ''I'm no stickler for historical accuracy. Sometimes it takes showmanship to make history interesting.''

      <Bio_Org_History>James Douglas ''Mike'' McKevitt was born October 26, 1928 in Spokane, Washington. He attended schools in Washington State and received a B.A. in political science from the University of Idaho in 1951. Academics were delayed while McKevitt served as a combat intelligence officer during the Korean War. After his discharge, he moved to Denver, Colorado to attend the University of Denver Law School. He received his law degree in 1956.

McKevitt practiced law in Boulder, Colorado until 1958, when he began his career in public service with an appointment as assistant attorney general for the State of Colorado. He held that position until 1967 when he was appointed by Governor John Love to the position of District Attorney for the City of Denver. In 1970 he was elected to the House of Representatives, the only Republican to represent the 1st Congressional District since 1946. While in Congress, he served on the Judiciary, Interior and Small Business Committees. In 1972, he was unsuccessful in his re-election bid against Patricia Schroeder. 

When he left office, McKevitt remained in Washington, D.C., serving as assistant attorney general for legislative affairs and, in 1973, counsel to the White House Energy Policy Office, which was headed by former Governor Love. In 1974 he became the federal legislation director of the National Federation of Independent Business. From 1986 to 1989, he practiced law in Washington, D.C. before founding McKevitt &amp; Schneier, a lobbying firm.

McKevitt was a founding member of the Korean War Veterans Memorial Board, and was a driving force in the completion of the project. He also served on the board of the United Service Organizations (USO), the U.S. Capitol Historical Society and the International Consortium for the Research on the Health Effects of Radiation. He was past president of the University Club of Washington, parliamentarian of the 1986 White House Conference on Small Business and a member of the Bowen Commission on Medicare. In his spare time, he loved sailing in Chesapeake Bay.

McKevitt married Doris Lester in 1952, and they raised two daughters. Doris McKevitt died in 1995. He later married Judith Woolley. McKevitt died September 28, 2000. He was survived by his wife and his two daughters, Julia Graf and Kate McLagan. He was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Donald Howard Menzel was born April 11, 1901 in Florence, Colorado. At 16 years old, Menzel enrolled at the University of Colorado to study chemistry. However, observing a solar eclipse in 1918 led him to change his course of study to astronomy. Menzel earned an internship at Princeton University, and spent summer vacations at Harvard University as a research assistant to Harlow Shapley. Menzel studied at the University of Denver and received his Ph.D. from Princeton. After earning his Ph.D. in 1924, Menzel taught at the University of Iowa and Ohio State University before being hired as assistant astronomer at the Lick Observatory in California in 1926. Menzel was among the first theoretical astrophysicists in the world. He worked at Lick Observatory until 1932 when he accepted a position at Harvard. From 1954-56 he was President of the American Astronomical Society. From 1964 to his death, Menzel was a U.S. State Department consultant for Latin American affairs.
He began teaching at Harvard in 1932, and earned full professorship in 1938; in 1952 he was appointed acting director of the Harvard Observatory, and was the full director from 1954 to 1966, when the observatory became an international center of radio astronomy. He retired from Harvard in 1971.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Arthur Scott Miller, a Colorado pioneer and Denver businessman, was born November 13, 1848 and spent his early years in Michigan. By 1869, he was teaching school in Bowne, Michigan. In 1873, he moved to Buffalo, New York where he worked as a court reporter. Eventually, he split his time between Buffalo and Fort Wayne, Indiana where he met and married Louise Lytle. The two lived in the boarding house that Louise Lytle’s mother owned. Together they had three children, Irene, Lawrence, and Roland. Lawrence died the day of his birth. In 1880, Arthur decided that Denver, Colorado would be a good up-and-coming place to establish himself and raise his family. So he moved himself and, a few months later, his family. Unfortunately, Louise Miller died when the children were still babies. Nevertheless, Arthur Miller quickly built up a thriving real estate business and became a leader in Denver. Around 1900, he married Emma Combs, a member of the Round Table Literary Club and the Colorado Chapter of The Daughters of the American Revolution. Together they had two children, Victor and Marcella. Arthur Miller was a member of the Royal Arcanum. __Marcella Miller duPont, born September 9, 1903, was the daughter of Emma Combs Miller and Arthur Scott Miller. She attended Wolcott School in Denver and Smith College in Northhampton, Massachusetts. She married Alfred Victor duPont in 1924. They lived for many years in Wilmington, Delaware and were divorced in 1948. Her poetry, published in Sonnets and Lyrics in 1950 and Poems: Folio Two in 1956, reflects the influence of Edna St. Vincent Milay and Emily Dickinson. 
Marcella Miller duPont attended Wolcott School for Girls from which she graduated in 1920. In a letter to Jane Gould of the University of Denver, Marcella duPont reminisced about her youth in New York: ''Your mentioning Frank Case reminded me of pre-War New York days when his daughter, Maggie Harriman, introduced me to her group, which included Lillian Hellman, Dorothy Parker, and a number of male New Yorker writers. As you can imagine, with these people there were conversational fireworks all the time that, by rights, should have touched off a major conflagration in the heart of New York City'' (from a letter to Jane Gould dated January 23, 1968). 

In 1966, Marcella duPont wrote to the University of Denver about endowing a study room in the library to house her papers and her brother’s collection: ''In other words, what I visualize is a room where students or scholars could work in pleasant, comfortable surroundings…'' (from letter of June 8, 1966). On May 26, 1967, the room was dedicated in honor of her parents who, she said, ''contributed to what Denver is today and to what Colorado is today'' (May 26, 1967 at the dedication of the room). In numerous letters to University faculty, Marcella's enthusiastic devotion was always conspicuous. As she once wrote, ''remember that when I am far away, I am always thinking … of the Room'' (from a letter of June 22, 1967). 

Marcella Miller duPont died September 17, 1985. 

Victor A. Miller was born October 12, 1898 in Denver, Colorado to Emma and Arthur Miller. He was educated in Denver Public Schools and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Yale in 1919, though he took off a year to serve as a second lieutenant in World War II. He received his law degree from the University of Denver Law School in 1922 and was a longtime member of the American, Colorado, and Denver Bar Associations. In 1920, he married Helen Ludlow Bingham of Denver. Together they had three daughters, Caroline, Victoria, and Marcella. He married again on September 25, 1937 to Beatrice Anita Andrews. He opened a private law practice in 1922 and was successful to the point of being nominated Colorado Attorney General in 1930, a position which he did not accept. He and his half-brother Roland ran Miller Estates, founded by their father Arthur S. Miller. He was a receiver for the Rio Grande Southern Railroad from 1929 to 1938 and directed Kesto Corporation and other organizations. He pioneered light motor rail transportation and developed policies for maintaining narrow gauge lines in Colorado. A member of the Colorado Yale Association, he was also active in the American Legion and became Commander-Elect in 1928. He was also the founder and author of ''Reveille,'' a publication for the American Legion community.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Notes>There is a discrepancy between the spelling of duPont and Du Pont in this collection. The Library of Congress Archives has conducted extensive research on the Du Pont name and all authority records indicate that the spelling should be Du Pont.  Marcella Miller Du Pont's LCNAF indicates that the spelling is Du Pont.  The OCLC record #46642398 reflects the LCNAF use of the name.

      <Scope-Content>The Miller and duPont Families Papers contains the materials of Arthur Miller and his children Victor A. Miller and Marcella Miller duPont. The collection covers the years from 1862 to 1978. The earliest material consists of 83 letters written by Joseph Edward ''Eddie'' Hodgekins, a Union soldier, to his family between the years 1862 and 1865. Victor Miller had a life long interest in the Civil War. At his death, his substantial library of books, letters, and other Civil War-related items was donated to the University of Denver. Besides the Hodgekins letters, there are 11 letters from Captain C.L. Fales to his sister Adelaide Fales Adams; a letter from General Johnston to General Sherman dated July 14, 1863 asking for a brief truce in order to bury the dead; a collection of signatures of people involved in the Civil War; an official report of the Battle of Shiloh; and other miscellaneous items.   

Arthur Miller’s diaries and rent books, the majority of which are written in shorthand, cover the years 1866 to 1912. These were saved by his son Roland and eventually were donated to the University of Denver by Arthur Miller and Marcella Miller duPont. The diaries begin when Arthur Miller was attending school in Michigan and continue as he taught school, traveled to New York to be a court reporter, lived in Fort Wayne, Indiana where he met and married his first wife, moved to Denver, and became a successful businessman. The collection includes the transcripts of the diaries from 1880 and 1881. Of particular interest in these years are Arthur Miller’s descriptions of his relationship with his wife and child as well as his opinion of the court cases he was handling and the events surrounding those cases.   

Marcella Miller duPont’s papers take up the chronology in 1932 with the first copies of letters from H.L. Mencken to Mrs. duPont. These letters marked the beginning of a decade and a half of correspondence. The collection also includes a nature journal created by M.M. duPont, Genevieve Kassler Brock, and Mary Frances Spaulding Brock when they were young. The most recent material includes a variety of personal papers relating to Marcella duPont’s social life including her summers spent in the East. This collection was at one time housed in the Marcella Miller duPont room in the Mary Reed Library at the University of Denver.</Scope-Content>

      <Bio_Org_History>Victor A. Miller was born October 12, 1898 in Denver, Colorado to Emma and Arthur Miller. He was educated in Denver Public Schools and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Yale in 1919, though he took off a year to serve as a second lieutenant in World War II. He received his law degree from the University of Denver Law School in 1922 and was a longtime member of the American, Colorado, and Denver Bar Associations. In 1920, he married Helen Ludlow Bingham of Denver. Together they had three daughters, Caroline, Victoria, and Marcella. He married again on September 25, 1937 to Beatrice Anita Andrews. He opened a private law practice in 1922 and was successful to the point of being nominated Colorado Attorney General in 1930, a position which he did not accept. He and his half-brother Roland together ran Miller Estates, founded by their father Arthur S. Miller. He was a receiver for the Rio Grande Southern Railroad from 1929 to 1938 and directed Kesto Corporation and other organizations. He pioneered light motor rail transportation and developed policies for maintaining narrow gauge lines in Colorado. A member of the Colorado Yale Association, he was also active in the American Legion and became Commander-Elect in 1928. He was also the founder and author of “Reveille,” a publication for the American Legion community.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Born in New York City on Feb. 9, 1915, Maurice Mitchell attended New York University and began his career in advertising working for the New York Times in 1935.  He also served as advertising director and managing editor of the Gouverneur Tribune Press (NY). From that position, he continued working as advertising director for three upstate New York daily papers. After his service with the Army Tank Corps in World War II, Mitchell’s interest in communications turned to the electronic field. Mitchell joined the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) as manager of the Washington, D.C. Station, WTOP. In 1948, he assumed an executive position with the National Association of Broadcasters and in 1950 joined the Muzak Corporation as vice-president. His success in that post led to his selection as President of Encyclopedia Britannica Films, Inc., in 1962. Through his job at the National Association of Broadcasters, Mitchell taught several summer seminars (1948-1950) in broadcasting and communications management at the University of Denver in Denver, Colorado. He resigned in 1967 to become Chancellor of the University of Denver. __Maurice Mitchell was inaugurated Chancellor of the University of Denver on October 20, 1967. He served as the thirteenth Chancellor of the University of Denver from 1967 to 1978. He brought experience in business, education, and national affairs to the post. He served as Chancellor for eleven years, leaving in 1978 to become President of the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, located in California. During his tenure at the University of Denver a host of new programs began, such as the annual Publishing Institute. Gifts also made several new buildings possible. The buildings constructed under his leadership include Penrose Library and the Shwayder Art Building. A noteworthy incident that occurred during his tenure was Woodstock West, a student protest against the Vietnam War. Due to his firm resolve, peace returned to campus and classes continued during the height of student protests across the United States.
He then left to work as President of the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions. Mitchell resigned from the Center when it merged with the University of California. In 1983, he became President of the Washington program at the Annenberg School of Communications. Mitchell served on the boards of many professional corporations and civic organizations including Colorado and Southern Railroad, the Federal Reserve Bank (Denver Branch), the Colorado State Historical Society, the United States Commission on Civil Rights, and the Colorado Springs Saving Bonds Committee. He received numerous awards for his hard work and dedication, including the Brotherhood Award, National Conference of Christians and Jews (1968); the George Washington Medal, Freedoms Foundation of Valley Forge (1969); the Service to Mankind Award, Mile High Sertoma Club (1970); the Golden Plate Award, American Academy of Achievement (1972); and the Malcolm Glenn Wyer Award of the Adult Education Council of Metropolitan Denver (1975). He married Mary V. Rowles in 1951. They had three children, Lee, Keith, and Deborah. Mrs. Mitchell was active in the University of Denver Women’s Association, the Kent School for Girls, and several other organizations. She passed away in 1991.

The younger Phipps was educated at Yale and served in the armed forces in World War I. After the war he helped resurrect the Arapahoe Hunt Club of which his father had been a founder. His interest and horses and riding also led him to be an active polo player and supporter.   He was also a businessman and rancher. He owned the land that would become Highlands Ranch and ran it as  working operation as well as  the home of the Arapahoe Hunt enabling that group to hunt coyotes with a pack of hounds.    Lawrence C. Phipps, Jr. died May 16, 1976.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>William Albert Recht was an educator and astronomer at the University of Denver from 1932 to his death in 1962. He was born in Cleveland, Ohio on March 22, 1898 to parents Albert J. and Anna Recht. Recht attended public schools in Arvada, Colorado and graduated from the University of Denver with a B.A. in 1920 and a M.A. in 1921. He received his Ph.D in 1939 from the University of Chicago. 

From 1920 to 1923, Recht was a high school principal and Spanish and math teacher in Eckley, Colorado and Wray, Colorado. He also spent six months in Nicaragua as a surveyor, mine sampler and shift boss at a gold refining mill. He joined the faculty of the University of Denver in 1923 as an instructor of mathematics. From 1930 to 1940 he was an assistant professor and from 1940 to 1945 he was an associate professor. After 1945 he became a professor of astronomy until his death. Under Herbert Alonzo Howe’s mentorship, Recht became acting director of the observatory in 1926 and director in 1930. He wrote a popular astronomy textbook, Space Trip for the Joneses, and believed that astronomy was for everyone. Recht served as director for the next 32 years. 


He was married in Denver on June 18, 1925 to Dorothy Walker. They had three children, Rodney Frank, John Albert and Janet. Recht died in Denver on January 8, 1962.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __A Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (''SLAPP'') was originally defined as a lawsuit involving communications made to influence a governmental action or outcome, which resulted in a civil complaint or counterclaim filed against nongovernment individuals or organizations on a substantive issue of some public interest or social significance.  Wikipedia continues that definition to say that ''This form of litigation is frequently filed by organizations or individuals to intimidate and silence critics or opponents by burdening them with the cost of a legal defense so that they abandon their criticism or opposition.''  Wilipedia also credits University of Denver professors Penelope Canan and George W. Pring with coining the acronym in the 1980s.  Canan and Pring continue to be in the forefront of SLAP research.  

Many of the early cases involved environmental groups who were sued by corporations when their outspoken concerns were thought to interfere with the business projects of the corporation.  Suits have also been filed against communities and individuals who speak out and petition against developers' plans.  There are even cases filed against individuals who have spoken out againt trade policies.  

Professors Canon and Pring were early researchers into this phenomenon on retaliatory litigation.  Their collection of material related to these types of lawsuits forms the core of this collection.  In addition to written publications by the two, they have hosted seminars and public forums on the subject.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Wilbur Daniel Steele (17 March 1886 in Greensboro, North Carolina - 26 May 1970 in Stamford, Connecticut) was a U.S. author and playwright. He was the son of Wilbur Fletcher Steele, who was a university of Denver Professor.
Wilbur Daniel received his degree from DU in 1907. In 1913 he married Margaret Thurston who was a talented painter. They had two sons. In 1931 Mrs. Steele died.

In 1932 he married Norma Mitchell, an actress and playwright with whom he collaborated on several plays. 

He was several times winner of the coveted O. Henry Short Story Prize. He traveled widely in Africa and Europe, basing many of his stories from various places he lived or visited. __In a career spanning five decades, Wilbur Daniel Steele produced nearly two hundred short stories, seven short-story collections, ten novels, and several plays, including two one-acts written for the Provincetown Players.In 1913 he married Margaret Thurston who was a talented painter. They had two sons. In 1931 Mrs. Steele died.

In 1932 he married Norma Mitchell, an actress and playwright with whom he collaborated on several plays. They make their home at Lynne, Connecticut where they still reside.

He was several times winner of the coveted O. Henry Short Story Prize. He traveled widely in Africa and Europe, basing many of his stories from various places he lived or visited. . Although a few of his best stories infrequently appear in anthologies and prose readers, none of his works is currently in print. Yet for a quarter century Steele was popularly and critically acclaimed as one of America's great short-story writers.

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The Constitution of the University Chapel Guild was adopted October 10, 1912, and gave as its object the completing and furnishing of the University Chapel, which was standing roofless on the campus.  In November of the same year a second objective was added:  to promote the social life of the Park.  The first pledge of $1,000 to tile the chapel roof was paid before January 1, 1914.  

The next project was a pledge of $2,500 for the Endowment Fund.  That goal was met by January, 1920.  Then they began raising money for a pipe organ and delivered $3,000 by 1930.  University Park was divided into districts for the fund-raising endeavor, and some years the districts were required to put on a special entertainment to aid the social life as well as gathering funds.  The Guild held food sales, rummage sales, fashion shows.  Entertainments and magazine subscription sales also augmented the funds.  

The use of funds for the Chapel had changed to other causes, and in 1930 the group changed its name to University Guild. Dues were $1.00 and meetings were held on the second Thursday of the month, usually with a guest speaker.  The Guild was a supporter of the YWCA on DU's campus. Among the presidents were Mrs. R. H. Biggs, Mrs. Henry A. Buchtel, Miss Ann McKeen Shuler and Mrs. W. B Iliff. 

A Chorus was first mentioned in the 1925 minutes and became a feature of the December meetings. The efforts of Mrs. Edward Milligan, University Park was the first neighborhood in Denver to hire a landscape architect, and they chose S. R. DeBoer.  By 1962, the Guild's fiftieth anniversary, it was no longer a fund raising organization, but a supporter of cultural life in the community.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Arrang_Organiz>The collection is arranged in five series.;  1.  Constitution and By-Laws.;  2.  Minutes.; 3.  Book Lists.;  4. History.;  5.  Memorabilia.;</Arrang_Organiz>
      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The exact origin of the University Park Reviewers Club is unclear.  There are indications that it began in 1913 when Miss Elizabeth McNeal, a librarian at the University of Denver, gathered with like-minded friends, both men and women, to discuss books.  Another possibility is that the mother of Mrs. Elsie Haines actually started a literary society around 1900.  Whichever version is true, the Reviewers had a sporadic start and the first documents from the group begin in 1918.  

The Reviewers met twice monthly in the evening.  Sometimes there were open meetings, with general discussions, and there were also instances of semi-open meetings when the members were allowed to bring guests.  The usual format was that one member would give a review of a book that person had recently read.  The meetings began at 8:00 and sometimes ran past 10:00 in the evening, so the reviews were quite detailed.  The minutes contain a condensation of the reviews and contain interesting insights into the opinions of the members.  A wide variety of books were reviewed, from political and treatises to plays and poetry.  In 1933 it was suggested that classics be reviewed instead of current books, but that idea did not gain support. 

The group had a constitution and by-laws.  The original constitution was apparently written in 1917, but the first copy that exists is of the 1924 version.  Meeting times and how the reviewers rotated caused revisions over the years.  Minutes of all the meetings were meticulously kept.  The people involved and the material chosen for review reflect the society of the community around the University of Denver.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Fred Kruse, Jr. attended University of Denver around 1904 and 1905, which are the years that the Registrar's office has for him.  He also attended Columbia University, which he called Columbia School of Mines, apparently after leaving DU.

      <Bio_Org_History_Biograph._History>Fred Kruse, Jr. attended University of Denver around 1904 and 1905, which are the years that the Registrar's office has for him.  He also attended Columbia University, which he called Columbia School of Mines, apparently after leaving DU.   His notebooks include notes on mathmetics, mechanics, mine bookkeeping, geology, and metalurgy, so he was probably involved in the mining industry.

      <Arrang_Organiz>The papers are organized into two series:;  1.  Writings.; 2.  Photographs.;</Arrang_Organiz>
      <Bio_Org_History>Thomas Russell Garth was born December 24, 1872 in Paducah, Kentucky.  He came to Colorado in 1903 to recover from tuberculosis.  He received a BA from the University of Denver in 1909 and a Masters the following year, before going to Columbia University for his PhD, which he earned in 1917.  He taught in various public schools in New York, Virginia and Texas.  He returned to Colorado from Austin, Texas where he was an assistant professor at the  State University.  In 1922, he was appointed head of the University of Denver’s Department of Experimental Psychology.  

Garth was a nationally known authority on race psychology.  Some of his many articles were translated into French and German.  His twenty years of study of ethnicity and intelligence led him to the conclusion that racial superiority was a myth.  Whether it was musical ability, I.Q., or handwriting, he found that all humans started out basically the same, and differences were largely the result of environment and experience.

Dr. Garth was head of the Universal Race Commission in 1920.  He headed a commission to study color blindness in Indians as well as Indian children in white foster homes.  In 1936-37 he was a specialist in the United States government Indian Service schools.  He was a member of the American Psychological Association, Association of Consulting Psychologists, American Anthropological Association, Association of University Professors,  and Colorado –Wyoming Academy of Science.

Dr. Garth wrote numerous articles and several books, including the Life of Henry Augustus Buchtel, the Chancellor of the University of Denver during his undergraduate days.  

Dr. Garth married Ethel Nadine Tucker of Denver in 1909.  They had two sons, Thomas and Francis and an adopted daughter, Nadine.  Dr. Garth collapsed in his classroom April 11, 1939 and died April 20, 1939, survived by his wife and three children.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Scope-Content>The Marcy M. Marconi Papers consist of thrity-five responses to a questionnaire sent out to women who had graduated from the Univeresity of Denver in the 1920s.  The questionnaire asked about the women's reasons for attending DU, how they were treated as females, and how the education they received at DU prepared them for their subsequent life work.  The responses that make up the collection vary widely in amount of detail given, but provide a snapshot of how these thirty-five women viewed their college career some sixty years after its completion.</Scope-Content>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The Wednesday Music Party was a music and social group of Denver women which met bi-weekly in the winter season at member's homes.  It began in September, 1906 and was active until at least May, 1973.  Its members included many of the city's social elite: Mmes Bosworth, Cranmer, Holme, Phipps, Grafton Rogers, Van Cise, Van Schaak, Waring, and others.  They took their music seriously.  ''Absolute silence while the music is going on'' was dictated in the by-laws.  There were fines for absence and tardiness of $0.25 and $0.10 respectively.  The social aspect seems to have been more lively.  There was a ''Spring Madness'' party in the mountains at each seasons end.</Bio_Org_History>

Its members included many of the city's social elite: Mmes Bosworth, Cranmer, Holme, Phipps, Grafton Rogers, Van Cise, Van Schaak, Waring, and others.  They took their music seriously.  ''Absolute silence while the music is going on'' was dictated in the by-laws.  There were fines for absence and tardiness of $0.25 and $0.10 respectively.  The social aspect seems to have been more lively.  There was a ''Spring Madness'' party in the mountains at each seasons end.</Bio_Org_History_Organiz._History>

      <Arrang_Organiz>The papers are organized into three series.  1.  William H. Aspinwall Papers.  2.  Lloyd Aspinwall Papers.  3.  Alcock - Aspinall correspondence.</Arrang_Organiz>
      <Bio_Org_History>The Aspinwalls were prominent New York shipping executives.  William H. Aspinwall joined the firm of Howland and Aspinwall, which was founded by his cousins.  He assumed control of the firm in 1835 and expanded its trade to South America, China, Europe, the Mediterranean and the East and West Indies.  In 1848 he started the Pacific Mail Steamship Company with a government contract to deliver mail from the Isthmus of Panama to Oregon Territory.  The discovery of gold in California ensured the success of the venture.  

After retiring, he was a founder of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  He died January 18, 1875.  

William's son, Lloyd, was born in 1830.  During the Civil War he was an aide to General Burnside at Fredericksburg.  After the war he became a brigadier general with the 4th New York Brigade. He continued his father's work with both steamships and railroads.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Provenance>G. W. Alcock received the papers from his brother, William A. Alcock, who was an attorney for the estate of one of the members of the Aspinwall family.  When G. W. Alcock noticed an announcement that one of Wayne Aspinall's sons had become the Governor of American Samoa, he wrote to Wayne Aspinall and inquired as to a possible connection between the families.  Although Wayne Aspinall did not feel the families were related, he was interested in the historical documents and Alcock sent him the documents that comprise this collection.  

The documents were found in the Wayne Aspinall collection that relates to his political career.  Since they appear to have no family connection, and were not germane to the Aspinall collection, they were separated into their own collection.</Provenance>

      <Scope-Content>The Aspinwall Family Papers consist of correspondence and documents from and to William H. Aspinwall from 1854 until the Civil War.  They cover both the steamship business and the lead up to the Civil War.  

The Lloyd Aspinwall papers include a letter from him to his father, and various letters to and about him, including one from General Burnside.

Finally, there are two letters from G. W. Alcock to Wayne Aspinall from 1967.  Alcock's brother rescued the letters and documents from being shredded when an estate of one of the Aspinwalls was closed.  He offered them to Wayne Aspinwall who was interested in the history even through he determined they were probably not related.</Scope-Content>

      <Arrang_Organiz>The papers are organized into three series. 1.  Biographical information.  2. Writings. 3.  Photographs.</Arrang_Organiz>
      <Bio_Org_History>Virginia E. Trevorrow had a long career as a biochemist with the Child Research Council.  She obtained her undergraduate degree from the University of Denver in 1931, MA at University of Colorado and PhD from Cornell.  After her retirement in 1970 she enjoyed photography and rock collecting.  A careful investor, she accumulated an estate of almost $9, most of which she bequeathed to the University of Denver. __Virginia E. Trevorrow was born in 1909 to Edwin and Zepha Trevorrow, and was raised in Independence, Colorado, where her father was a superintendent of a gold mining venture.  Gold production diminished in the early 1920s.  The loss of the mining economy, coupled with her father's death, caused Virginia's mother to move to Denver where Virginia attended West High School.  

Virginia received her bachelors degree from the University of Denver and went on to receive a masters from Universtiy of Colorado.  At that point she began working as a research biochemist at the Child Research Council, a facility funded through the University of Colorado Medical Center.  After her mother died in the early 1940s, Virginia went to Cornell to get her PhD, before returning to the Child Research Council.  She retired from there in 1970.

When Virginia returned to Denver in the 1940s she joined an old  high school friend, Vera Winchester, in buying a home near Aurora Hills Golf Course.  The two lived frugally, and invested their extra income in stocks and bonds.  After she retired, Virginia and Vera built a model railroad in their basement.  Virginia also became interested in photography and indulged in rock collecting.  The two women traveled around the world and Virginia collected rock specimens from the countries she visited.  

Virginia and Vera enjoyed attending concerts at the Lamont School of Music, and Virginia remained interested in her alma mater.  When cancer struck in 1997, Virginia made arrangements to leave the bulk of her estate to the University of Denver, after making provision for Vera's final years.  

Virginia died September 12, 1997.  Her legacy to the University served as an impetus for the University of launch the construction of a new performing arts center.  The portion of the building that houses the Lamont School of Music is named in her honor, Trevorrow Hall.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Abstract>Vera Sears, formerly Vera Elsa Schultz-Bergen, was born in Dresden, Germany in 1912. Sears' family moved to Berlin and, at age 10, she began to study at the Berlin Opera School. Sears married Edwin Sieradz, an attorney who was Jewish, in 1934. The two moved to the United States soon after Hitler came to power, largely because neither she nor her husband were allowed to work, and soon after changed their name to Sears. Vera Sears studied with noted choreographer and dance educator Hanya Holm in Colorado Springs, Colorado where she met Martha Wilcox, another student of Holm, and became interested in modern dance. Sears and Wilcox both worked for the Lamont School of Music at the University of Denver in Denver, Colorado, and Sears taught at the Children's Dance Theatre (a part of the University of Denver Lamont School of Music), serving as director for 17 years. Sears died March 8, 2008.

This collection contains photographs, primarily of Sears' involvement with the University of Denver Lamont School of Music, dance programs, announcements of performances, correspondence, as well as newspaper and magazine clippings.</Abstract>

      <Bio_Org_History>Eddie Miller was born and raised in Leetonia, Minnesota, the son of Croatian immigrants.  He played softball, hockey and football in youth recreational leagues.  He attended Hibbing High School, where he lettered in football and competed in track.  He graduated in 1945 and enlisted in the Navy.  After serving two years he was discharged and worked in the mines for two years.  During this period he played Class A the Leetonia team.  In 1949, he was offered a scholarship to the University of Denver.

As one of the first members of the University of Denver hockey team, Miller helped lay the groundwork for the future success of the Pioneer hockey program. Coming to Denver in the first year of the program, Miller was a three-year letterman. He left as Denver's first-ever hockey All-American, an honor he received in 1952. During Miller's stay with the program, the team had a combined record of 50-36-3. His sophomore year, Miller led the club in number of goals scored (26) as well as total points (44). Despite moving to a defenseman position the next year, Miller was 32nd in the Midwest Hockey League in individual scoring with eight goals and 14 assists during the 1951-52 season. He was a Denver Post all-Midwest first-team selection two years in a row and served as the team's co-captain in 1952.

After DU, he taught and coached at Baudette, Minnesota before moving to Wayzata in 1955.  He spend more than 30 years teaching and coaching hockey.  He also played Senior Amateur Hockey for the Minneapolis Bungalow team, which won the National title in 1957.  At that National tournament Eddie was named to the All-Tourney first squad and named the National Division's most valuable player in April 1957.  In 1958, he was invited to play on the United States National team in the tournament in Oslo, Norway.  

He was inducted into the Hibbing Hall of Fame in 1996 and the University of Denver Athletic Hall of Fame in 2000.  Eddie and his wife Elizabeth are the parents of four children.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Loraine Capps Kehl was born July 1, 1920.  She was the first child of Ora Lee and Nell Nicholson Capps.  Loraine and her younger brother, Larry, were raised in Northwest Denver. Loraine attended Skinner Junior High and graduated from North High School in 1938.  She was one of the students who attended the University of Denver while living at home, traveling to her classes by the trolley cars that earned DU the nickname “Tramway Tech.”  She graduated from DU in 1942 and began teaching in Denver Public Schools. __During her college years, she met Dale W. Kehl.  Dale had left home early in his life and was taking classes as well as working.  They were married on May 3, 1943 in Walla Walla, Washington, where Dale was stationed with the Army Air Corps for flight training. The couple spent most of the war in Florida, where their son, Dale, Jr. was born in 1945.  After the war they returned to Denver, and Dale opened a printing business.  In 1947, another son, Gary, was born.  

The Kehls lived a life similar to many in the post-war era.  He ran a successful business; she stayed home to raise their sons.  They were both active in the Shrine and Masonic organizations, he serving as Potentate and she as Queen of Daughters of the Nile.  They were active in their son’s schools and took part in other civic activities through the Rotary Club and other organizations.  Through their activities and long residence in Jefferson County, they acquired a large circle of friends and entertained often.

After Gary left home for college, Loraine went back to school and earned her Masters of Education from the University of Colorado.  She then went on to teach, mostly second grade, in Jefferson County until 1982 when she retired.  Dale had retired before that, selling out of the printing business when he saw copy machines and computers as the way of the future.  He then devoted his time to investing and real estate.

After Loraine retired, she and Dale traveled the world, circling the globe.  They loved traveling and took many photographs of their journeys, as well as informational material. They visited the Holy Lands and Egypt, taking Loraine’s mother along.  One of their highlights was a trip to China in 1988.  

They loved being with family.  They added a swimming pool to their home on Green Mountain, which was a favorite meeting place as Dale, Jr. had children and their good friends Tom and June Hammond had grandchildren about the same ages. After her mother died, Loraine volunteered at Lutheran Medical Center, as well as remaining active in Daughters of the Nile.  As they got older they began spending the winter months in Mesa, Arizona, finally buying a unit at Leisure World.  By the late 1990s, Dale’s health began to fail as he battled emphysema.  Dale died in 2000.  Their son, Gary, died of lung cancer two years later, a severe blow to Loraine.  But she continued to be active with her activities, tap dancing and exercising, until a broken pelvis curtailed her.  She died May 28, 2008.

Loraine’s family had a long association with Colorado and she became the keeper of the family information.     Her father grew up in Missouri and was a schoolteacher and superintendent in Missouri and Oklahoma before World War I.  In the War he served in France, where he was awarded a Purple Heart and the Silver Star for gallantry.  After the war he received his law degree from the University of Denver in 1925.  He was an attorney for the Veterans Administration in Denver until his retirement in 1958.  He was active in the Shrine and Veterans organizations.  

Loraine’s mother, Nell Nicholson Capps, was born May 5, 1893 to a Denver pioneer family.  Her mother’s ancestors with names of Larrick and Nicholson are among the old graves in Crown Hill Cemetery in Wheat Ridge. Nell attended Montclair Elementary School and graduated from Arvada High School.  She was a graduate of State Teachers College in Greeley.  She taught music in the public schools as well as teaching piano and organ privately.  Like her husband and Loraine and Dale, she was active in the Shrine, Daughters of the American Revolution and other civic groups.

The Daughters of the American Revolution started the family interest in genealogy.  Nell’s sister, Bessie Pearl Nicholson, did extensive research on the family.  Pearl, as she was known to the family, received degrees from both Colorado Woman’s College in Denver and Colorado State Teachers College in Greeley.  She taught her entire career, most of which was spent in California.  She was very active in the DAR and upon her death her genealogical research material was left to her sister, Nell, and then to Loraine.</Bio_Org_History>

She taught music in the public schools as well as teaching piano and organ privately.  Like her husband and Loraine and Dale, she was active in the Shrine, Daughters of the American Revolution and other civic groups.

The Daughters of the American Revolution started the family interest in genealogy.  Nell’s sister, Bessie Pearl Nicholson, did extensive research on the family.  Pearl, as she was known to the family, received degrees from both Colorado Woman’s College in Denver and Colorado State Teachers College in Greeley.  She taught her entire career, most of which was spent in California.  She was very active in the DAR and upon her death her genealogical research material was left to her sister, Nell, and then to Loraine.</Bio_Org_History_Bio._Expansion>

      <Abstract>The Bibliographical Center for Research, Rocky Mountain Region, Inc., was founded in 1935 as a resource sharing focused organization assisting researchers and libraries with locating materials held in libraries outside their local community. Before automating, BCR maintained a card catalog with over 6 million catalog cards from major libraries in the West and throughout the country. As online database searching became prevalent, BCR refocused its efforts on offering access and training for computerized resources and services.  The collection consists of the historical records of the organization including client files, human resources/personnel, and financial records.</Abstract>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The Bibliographical Center for Research, Rocky Mountain Region, Inc., was founded in 1935 as a resource sharing focused organization assisting researchers and libraries with locating materials held in libraries outside their local community. Before automating, BCR maintained a card catalog with over 6 million catalog cards from major libraries in the West and throughout the country. As online database searching became prevalent, BCR refocused its efforts on offering access and training for computerized resources and services. Most recently, BCR served over 8,000 member libraries in primarily an 11-state region as a regional network offering OCLC products and services, training and consulting, and discounts on products and services from over 60 business partners. BCR was unique among its regional network peers because of its close relationship with state library agencies, who paid for statewide membership on behalf of all libraries in their states. As of December 31, 2010, the Biblographical Center for Research, BCR, has closed its doors. BCR can be reached through its mailing address, PO Box 681, Arvada, Colorado, 80001 or via email, accounting@bcr.org.  BCR's™ organization historical documents will be housed in the archives at the University of Denver.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Abstract>The University of Denver, Denver, Colorado supported its School of Architecture and Planning from 1946-1952.  A combined venture of the College of Arts and Science, the College of Business Administration and the College of Engineering, the School offered a 5-year bachelor degree with minors in Architecture, Physical Planning, Architectural Construction and Interior Design.  Professor Carl Feiss was the first director.
 By 1952, the School had not applied for accreditation and had competition from the newly opened School of Architecture at the University of Colorado.  The University of Denver school closed at the end of the academic year in 1952, having graduated less than 100 students.
The records contain brochures, bulletins, correspondence, reports, course descriptions, lists of applicants and degree candidates, meeting minutes and memos from the Architectural Advisory Committee, and material on the formation and closing of the School from 1946 to 1952.</Abstract>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __On June 17, 1946, Caleb F. Gates, Chancellor of the University of Denver, sent a memorandum to the Board of Trustees, recommending that a School of Architecture and Planning be established in the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Denver, to be located on the Civic Center Campus. Provisions for additional drafting space were made in Rodney Curtis Hall, in the Monroe Hotel located at 230 15th Street, Denver, Colorado, and in the workshop of Clayton Plumbing Company.  

The justification advanced for the establishment of such a school was the lack of any school of architecture between Lincoln, Nebraska and the West Coast. Further, such a school at the University of Denver could draw upon its existing faculty. 

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences would be combined with the School of Business Administration and the School of Engineering to serve in this capacity. Accrediting requirements were explored in some detail in 1951, but the decision for accreditation was postponed for one year. A Bachelor's Degree in Architecture and Planning in the College of Arts and Sciences was proposed. The 1947 to 1950 brochures outlined a 5-year basic curriculum. After two years of operation, the director submitted a revision for the last three years of the training program and submitted it to Dean James E. Perdue on January 30, 1948. The revision was a rearrangement of the sequence of courses. Relationships of additional curricular studies in other areas of the University were stipulated for Engineering, Business Administration and Law, Arts and Sciences and the Library.

The Director of the School was Professor Carl Feiss and Leonard Currie was temporarily designated as Assistant to the Director and Assistant Professor. Joseph Shelley was designated as instructor. The 1949 correspondence names Carl Feiss as Director. In the 1950 Report, Professor Vance Kirkland is listed as Director (administration only). Others listed are: Eugene Steinberg, Associate Professor; Howard Miller, Assistant Professor; and Victor Horbein, Instructor. 

A Professional Advisory Committee of eight men was appointed. The initial recommendation to the Board of Trustees outlined a tentative basic curriculum of three quarters and a recommended budget. Members of the Advisory Committee consisted of practicing architects, planners and the builders. They were: Paul Atchison, Alan Fisher, Burnham Hoyt, Irvin McCrary, G. Meredith Musick, Thomas Moore, Earl Morris and Lyle Webber. 

The graduation of June 10, 1952 had 16 students who had been cleared for the Bachelor of Arts degree, with a major in Architecture. Seven students were granted a Bachelor of Architecture and Planning. 

The December 17, 1951 report by J. M. Shelley states that the basic aims of the school had still not been accomplished. He believed that outside subsidy was justified; that private practice by members should be approved; and he emphasized the need for a full-time permanent Director. 

In 1952, the School of Architecture and Planning at the University of Denver was discontinued, the probable cause being competition from the newly established School of Architecture in the College of Engineering at the University of Colorado. The University of Denver, a private school and dependent upon outside subsidies, apparently felt it could not successfully compete with a large state-supported program. Furthermore, two schools of architecture, so close geographically, were not warranted.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Arrang_Organiz>This collection is arranged in one series:; 1. Dental School Records.;</Arrang_Organiz>
      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The School of Dentistry was created with a $500 grant from the Trustees of the University of Denver and an agreement by which a group of Denver, Colorado, dentists agreed to provide supervision and instruction in a dental department for the University. In the fall of 1888 the first classes were held in the Haish Building at 14th and Arapahoe Street. __The first course was five months in length, with the first class graduating in 1889. That course schedule was increased to three seven-month semesters in 1891, when the School became a member of the National Association of Dental Faculties. The entrance requirements were also strengthened to require a high school diploma or a first class teacher's certificate. To provide training for students the school advertised in local newspapers, offering dental work for cost from 1:00 to 5:00 p.m. 

In 1896 the School of Dentistry took over the entire first floor of the Haish Building. At the same time a formal agreement was reached to divide the profits between the faculty of the School and the Trustees of the University of Denver. The University of Colorado in Boulder, Colorado, also attempted to start a dental school in the 1890s, locating it in Denver. The University of Denver protested its location in Denver, as opposed to Boulder, so the Colorado College of Dental Surgery was created by five individual dentists. 

By the turn of the century, it was apparent that there was no need for two dental colleges, and on March 8, 1901 the Trustees of the University of Denver agreed to merge the two schools. The resulting Colorado College of Dental Surgery was considered to be the Dental Department of the University of Denver. Dr. L. S. Gilbert was the first Dean, but resigned in May 1901. His successor was Dr. W. T. Chambers, who served as Dean until 1914. The arrangement was similar to the old dental school in that the School was actually owned by the faculty members through a contract with the University of Denver. 

In 1904 the three-year course was extended to four years, but was returned to three years in 1906 to retain students who wanted a shorter course of study. The college moved into new quarters in 1911, and added additional space in 1914. At that time the college introduced an eight-month course to train dental nurses, which was the first such program in the United States . By 1917 the program was again extended to four years, and in 1926 a five-year degree program was instituted. That remained the standard until the school closed in 1932. 

Pressure was building in the medical and dental communities nation-wide to have more stringent controls over the training of medical and dental professionals. Proprietary schools, schools owned by practitioners, in particular were criticized. In 1918 the first ranking of dental school in the United States placed Colorado College of Dental Surgery in Class B. One of the ways to overcome the ratings and perceived shortcomings was to affiliate with the University. While the school had been tenuously associated with the University of Denver, on June 15, 1922, the University agreed to assume full responsibility for the school. The school, which had been profitable under the proprietors, was not a financial success since the University needed to expend considerable funds in an attempt to bring the school up to Class A ranking. An attempt was made to transfer the Dental Department to the University of Colorado in affiliation with the medical school. The stock collapse of 1929 and ensuing depression complicated that plan because the University of Colorado would not accept the school without the finances to be self-supporting. All attempts to finance the School of Dentistry through the State failed. The school continued until June 8, 1932, to allow students to complete their course work. During its existence, the Colorado College of Dental Surgery had graduated more than 1,000 dentists with accredited degrees.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The University of Denver College of Law opened its doors in 1892, pioneering legal education on America's frontier. The law school initially adopted an apprenticeship model of legal education, recruiting attorneys in Denver to teach students the nuts and bolts of the practice of law. Students gained insight from their practitioner professors; aside from the rigors of classroom study, students also observed courtroom proceedings. This approach to teaching students by employing in-the-field methods remains at the heart of DU Law. The College was renamed Sturm College of Law in September 2004. __A pioneer amidst pioneers, the College of Law opened the doors to its Legal Aid Dispensary in 1904, thus creating the first clinical program in the nation and the precursor to DU Law's Student Law Office (SLO). A frontrunner in serving Denver's indigent populations, the Dispensary saw several incarnations before it evolved into the law school's present day clinical programs. The Westminster College of Law (founded in 1912) merged with the University of Denver College of Law in 1957. Westminster provided the only evening program of law study from Kansas City to the Pacific Coast. Evolving accreditation standards eventually required too large a budget for the strictly part-time institution, and the school merged with the University of Denver. Terms of the merger included naming the law library the Westminster Law Library, and the development of an evening program at the College of Law.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __In 1903, the medical department merged with the Gross Medical College, one of its competitors. Following the Denver and Gross College of Medicine's move to the campus chartered by the Colorado Seminary in 1907, the school was forced to transfer its operations to the University of Colorado to improve operations.  This action terminated the Denver and Gross College of Medicine's relationship with the University of Denver. __The Medical Department of the University of Denver was established on June 9, 1881. Within two years of the program's inception it graduated five students, with 16 undergraduates, including one woman, continuing their curriculum. The department was incorporated on August 10, 1899, as the Denver College of Medicine through an agreement with the College of Medicine and the University of Denver. In 1877, another group of Denver doctors, recent colleagues and friendly competitors of the Denver school, started the Gross Medical College. Yet, in 1903, the two medical schools merged and as part of the agreement, the Colorado Seminary, the University of Denver's charter institution, agreed to provide facilities for the Denver and Gross College of Medicine in the Haish Building, located at 14th and Arapahoe Streets, Denver. In 1907, a new building was constructed for the Medical College for use as a dispensary and clinic. However, following review from the the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association and Association of American Medical Colleges, and the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching researched by Abraham Flexnor the school fell under scrutiny for substandard medical care. Flexner's Report called for a reorganization of medical education and recommended that The Denver and Gross College consolidate with the University of Colorado School so as to improve conditions and minimize duplicative resources.  Following heated debates, the executive board of the Denver and Gross College of Medicine demanded that the trustees of the University of Denver either grant finances appropriate to sustain a modern top class institution or approve the transfer of the program to the University of Colorado. An agreement was reached and the consolidation was effective in 1912.  This action terminated the Denver and Gross College of Medicine's relationship with the University of Denver.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Arrang_Organiz>The records are arranged in three series:  1. Proposals, 1961-1965. 2. Brochures and Announcements, 1947-1967. 3.  "Call Letter" Newsletter, 1950-1956.</Arrang_Organiz>
      <Bio_Org_History>According to the documentation on file, the Department of Radio - Television and later -Film was developed within the School of Communications, which as previously the Department of Oratory created in 1894, in 1947.  Developed by R. Russell Porter and others, the radio and television program was adopted to adapt to the growing demands for training in these new medias. It provided its students practical and functional training for successful careers in communications media as well as workshops and clinics in its early days. Yet, as demand grew, so too did the program providing four-year and later gradute degrees in all areas of radio, television and film. The department had a long history of close relations with campus and local radio and television stations providing students the practical applications of their newly learned skills.  During the 1960s there were several initiatives by Porter and later department chair Harold A. Mendelsohn to develop educational and social service programing from television media.  In 1966 the department was combined with the fledgling Department of Journalism to create the Department of Mass-Communications.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Scope-Content>Although a small number of records, they contain a good deal of information on the Department of Radio - Television - Film.  Series 1. Proposals, 1961-1965 includes the 1961 requests for Ford Foundation funding by R. Russell Porter, former department chair for exploring ways in which television might be utilized for educational purposes in the classroom.  This is in the form of two drafts.  The second proposal, also a draft, is one from the department's Director of Research Harold Mendelsohn dated 1965 on a public survey on race relations between government agencies, including local police and minority groups.  Series 2 includes the departments brochures and publications announcing course and program offerings from 1947 to 1967.  The third series are copies of the department's newsletter "Call Letter" which describes program happenings and member achievements.  This collection consists of volumes 2 to 6 from 1950 to 1956.</Scope-Content>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __Many of the disciplines that make up the Social Sciences were offered at the University since its inception in one form or another.  A Major in the Social Sciences was offered in the 1930s through the School of Liberal Arts.  By 1946 the Social Sciences were their own Division.  There was always discussion of what subjects and under what curriculum the subjects would be offered.  For a while there was an American Government speciality that over the years became the Political Science and Public Policy sections.  Education was a part of the Department before becomming its own school.  The basics of the offerings have remained constant in developing insights into human beings as members of groups and as individuals.  Anthropology and  Economics have been joined by Communications and Cultural Studies as well as Psychology and Sociology.  

The structure of the Social Sciences have also changed from being a mere major to being a Division of the Department of Arts and Sciences and finally to its current home in the Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences.</Bio_Org_History>

In 1936, the name was changed to the University College in order to prevent confusion that was caused by the use of the title City College.  The University College closed in 1946.</Bio_Org_History_Organiz._History>

      <Abstract>As of 1882, the University of Denver had a Preparatory School for high school students and a Junior Preparatory School for grammar school children. The Preparatory School was renamed Warren Academy in 1909 after moving into the basement of the new Carnegie Library on campus. The Warren Academy closed in 1916. It is unclear when the Junior Preparatory School closed but items in the records indicate that the school was still operating in 1889-1890. Records of the schools include grade books, bulletins, a yearbook, graduation certificates, articles, a photo and programs for school functions.</Abstract>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The Women's College of the University of Denver began in 1909 as the Colorado Woman's Baptist College.  By the year 1915, enrollment in the college had reached 178 students.  In 1967, the college reached an all-time high in enrollment at 1,117 students, and was renamed Temple Buell College after a gift of $25 million from Temple Buell.  In 1973, the name was changed back to Colorado Women's College. __In 1976, the Colorado Women's College proposed a merger with the University of Denver due to financial difficulties, but the offer was declined by DU.  In an effort to explore a more diverse student base, CWC began The Weekend College program in 1979.  Financial problems continued for CWC, and the College again approached the University of Denver about a merger.  After a study conducted by both institutions, the University of Denver acquired CWC in 1982.  The University of Denver continued The Weekend College as a part of its Daniels College of Business.

In 1993, Michele Bloom became the Exectutive Director of The Weekend College.  The Weekend College existed as a continuing education program for women, and Bloom renamed the program The Women's College in the same year she became Executive Director.  The Women's College became a separate academic unit within the University, and Michele Bloom was named its first Dean in 1997.

In 1999, The Women's College moved to the University Park Campus, and the construction of a Women's Center was announced.  In 2004, the Merle Chambers Center for the Advancement of Women was completed and opened.

In 2007, Dr. Lynn M. Gangone was named the second Dean of The Women's College, and Michele Bloom was named Dean Emerita.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The Board of Trustees is the governing body for the University of Denver.  On March 4, 1964 Territorial Governor John Evans signed an ''Act to incorporate Colorado Seminary.''  There were twenty-eight original incorporators, and that number is continued in the number of trustees.  Governor Evans was the first president of the Board of Trustees.  The University of Denver was organized in 1880.  Its constitution gave its aim as conferring degrees.  It was described as a society, the members being four representatives of the Methodist Episcopal Church, the President of Colorado Seminary, and the Executive Committee of the Board of Trustees of Colorado Seminiary.   A 1977 Memorandum outlines the reasons for two annual meetings by describing the role of the University of Denver as authorizing and conferring degrees, nominating trustees and electing officers.  The Board of Trustees of Colorado Seminary meets four times yearly for the purpose of handling business relating t the University as a corporation, such as deeds, contracts and formal documents. __Certain functions of the board are delegated to subordinate committees.  The first both in time and importance is the executive commmittee which exercises the powers of the Board between meetings.  Other areas of governance have been delegated to committees.  for example, in 1999 the Trustees provides guidance and oversight in the following areas:  Athletic Affairs; Audit; Building and Grounds; Faculty and Educational Affairs; Finance and Budget; Investment; Student and Alumni Affairs; Trustee Affairs; and University Advancement.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History_Organiz._History>The Board of Trustees is the governing body for the University of Denver.  On March 4, 1964 Territorial Governor John Evans signed an ''Act to incorporate Colorado Seminary.''  There were twenty-eight original incorporators, and that number is continued in the number of trustees.  Governor Evans was the first president of the Board of Trustees.

      <Scope-Content>The Board of Trustees Records include the records of the Board of Trustees of Colorado Seminary, an entity created by Legislative Charter in 1864 which holds legal title to University property, and the Board of Trustees of the University of Denver, the corporation that grants degrees earned in the University.  It also includes minutes and associated documents of committees of the boards.

The official minutes of the Boards are contained in bound volumes, as are the minutes of the Executive Committee of the Board and certain minutes of other committees.  The associated materials, including agendas and packages of material sent to the Board members prior to meetings are not complete.  These documents were kept by the Chancellors and were often transferred to the Archives with the Chancellors files.  Beginning in the 1960s attempts were made to transfer this material directly to the Archives as a part of the Board of Trustees documents, but there are still gaps in the record.  To gain the complete record of back-up material, it may be necessary to access the Chancellors' records.</Scope-Content>

In 1916, an Alumnae Association was established for female graduates and contributed minutes to the collection until the late 1920s.  By 1927 the Alumni Association was large enough that it needed an on-campus coordinating entity, and an Alumni Office was created.  

Over the years the alumni of the University have been active in every capital campaign through the Alumni Fund.  Alumni Relations also manages reunions and outreach.  There are eleven alumni associations associated with current schools, and nine regional groups which sponsor events and maintain contacts with alumni in the area.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The Art Conservation Center at the University of Denver was the last name of an art conservation group that began as the Rocky Mountain Regional Conservation Center in 1977.  The announcement of the Center’s opening was made April 4, 1977, but the Constitution and By-laws of the Rocky Mountain Regional Conservation Consortium, the governing body of the Center was not adopted until April 27, 1977.  The Consortium began with eight members, each of which was assessed $800 to begin the Center.  Other funding came from an NEA grant and a gift from the Shwayder Foundation to furnish a conservation laboratory.  

The University of Denver agreed to provide the space for the lab and in a 1978 memo, Vice Chancellor Kay clarified the Center’s status within the University by saying that “The Rocky Mountain Conservation Center is a unit of the University responsible to the Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs . . . “  The Center’s purpose was to provide analysis, care and treatment of works of art and culturally valuable objects.  Initially the Center handled paintings, paper and objects.  Textiles were added in 1983.  The Center’s fee for conservation work was determined by the complexity of the work, with consortium members receiving a discount.  The conservator would examine a work and make a proposal for treatment that outlined the cost of the procedure.  

The equipment that was used by the Center was state of the art and expensive.  The Center was intended to be a self-supporting unit of the University, but seldom reached that goal and so was affected by the financial fluctuations of the University.  The general economy of the region also affected the decisions of institutions and individuals to have material professionally conserved.  In 1985 the University considered discontinuing the funding for the Center, but the Center was able to increase its revenues and members, so the University continued its support.  In 2001 the financial situation of the Center was again critical, but this time the Center was not able to rally the support of the University or the conservation community and the Center was closed.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __On October 3, 1946 the University of Denver issued a news release which announced the opening of a Bureau of Industrial Research.  In a University press release its purpose was stated to be “to conduct research requested by local industries who have no research facilities available within their own organizations.  Through the utilization of the Bureau’s services, it is expected that industry of the Rocky Mountain area will be aided in developing raw materials and uses for by-products, as well as in producing new and improved products.”  The idea of educational institutions partnering with private industry to solve logistical and production problems came out of such partnerships developed during the Second World War. 
The initial director of the bureau was Dr. Ralph M. Conrad.  His PhD was in Chemistry, and during the war he had worked with the Committee on Food Research to develop dried products, especially egg products, to supply the troops.  Dr. Conrad’s contacts within government and industry were important factors in the founding of DRI.  Tragically Dr. Conrad was killed in a river rafting accident in 1948, but the Bureau continued.  While the press release called the research facility the Bureau of Industrial Research, and it was listed as such in the University Bulletins, annual reports to the University Chancellor were made in the name of the Institute for Industrial Research.  Then on November 24, 1952, the name was officially changed by a resolution of the University Board of Trustees to Denver Research Institute.
In the 1950-1951 annual report, the Institute reported 20 projects.  By the 1952-53 report, there were 69 projects, 34 for industry and 35 for the Defense effort.  Seventy-nine industrial sponsors were listed for that year, and 16 federal agency sponsors.  Research was conducted in five areas: Chemistry, Electronics, Mechanics, Metallurgy, and Physics.
By 1965-66 an academic element had been added to the research.  Thirty research staff members taught a total of 179 credit hours in Arts and Sciences and 161 in College of Engineering.  Subjects varied from metallurgy and mechanics to industrial economy and electronics.  Grants to DRI totaled $6,588,940 covering  over 300 contracts.  During the 1970s DRI had a Center for Social Research and Development that studied social policy issues and human service delivery systems.   
 DRI continued to grow, and add divisions:  Mathematical Sciences and Industrial Economics.  Industrial Economics included such areas as market research, recreation and tourism evaluations, urban analysis, and motivational research in addition to more traditional areas such as energy resources policies and forecasts and environmental problems.  Under the division of Industrial Product and Process Development research was conducted on Energy Sources &amp; Technologies (biomass, alternative fuels, oil shale, electric vehicles),  Materials processing (explosive metals, armor and anti-armor technology, ceramics), Composites and Non-Metallic Materials (graphite-aluminum composites, Kevlar bulletproof fabrics), Minerals and Materials Extraction and processing (ores, trace metals from oil shale, economic feasibility studies).
The division of Economics and Management also broke new ground with research in Regional Economics and Growth Management (water economics and policy, hazardous waste economics and policy, resource management, reuse and recycling), business planning and management (marketing studies, financial planning, telecommunications economics and policy, real estate feasibility analysis, public opinion and attitude research), technology management (R&amp;D management, transfer systems design, implementation and management, innovation, regulation and productivity) 
DRI published the reports of these various research efforts, and these reports are often important research tools as science moves forward.  DRI’s focus and projects have depended on the priorities of the parties providing funding, including the federal government.  The projects in the 21st century differ from those of the mid-twentieth century, but the research facilities continue to function.</Bio_Org_History>
      <Bio_Org_History_Organiz._History>On October 3, 1946 the University of Denver issued a news release which announced the opening of a Bureau of Industrial Research.  In a University press release its purpose was stated to be “to conduct research requested by local industries who have no research facilities available within their own organizations.  Through the utilization of the Bureau’s services, it is expected that industry of the Rocky Mountain area will be aided in developing raw materials and uses for by-products, as well as in producing new and improved products.”  The idea of educational institutions partnering with private industry to solve logistical and production problems came out of such partnerships developed during the Second World War. 
The initial director of the bureau was Dr. Ralph M. Conrad.  His PhD was in Chemistry, and during the war he had worked with the Committee on Food Research to develop dried products, especially egg products, to supply the troops.

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __Urban Observatories was a project conceived by the National League of Cities.  It was an experimental organization set up to link an urban city government with local university capabilities in urban research, training and service.  Funds were made available through the Federal Government to support the effort.  The Denver Urban Observatory began in 1970, and was composed of city officials and representatives of the University of Colorado, University of Denver, Community College of Denver, and Metro State College of Denver. Its purpose was to analyze the research needs of local government officials and others interested in solving urban problems and to develop comparable, reliable data of general application to the nation's cities.  One of the elements of the research was to be an analysis of revenues and possible alternative or supplemental sources of revenues for city services.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The University of Denver has had three library structures. These were the Carnegie Library (1908-1932), Mary Reed Library (1932-1972) and the current Penrose Library (1972-present). __The Carnegie Library was the first separate library structure built on the University of Denver University Park campus. It was built more than forty years after DU was founded in 1864. Just after the turn of the 20th century the University needed a library capable of meeting its rapidly-growing information needs. In 1906 the famous steel magnate Andrew Carnegie agreed to donate $30,000 toward a library if the school could raise matching funds. The University met the challenge and by 1908 had a new library. The building was just the third constructed at the University Park campus. Having already designed the first two, University Hall and Chamberlin Observatory, Robert Roeschlaub assumed the role of designing the campus library. Not surprisingly the structure employed the standard Carnegie Classical aesthetic. It was the last of 108 libraries that Carnegie funded personally. The 9,600 square foot one-story library included a basement and main floor.

   What is now called the Mary Reed Building was constructed as the Mary Reed Library in 1932. A stone inscription on the front (east side) of the structure still reads “Mary Reed Library” though it has not served that function for almost forty years. The Carnegie Library which it replaced was barely 20 years old but already incapable of meeting the University’s growing need for library resources. To find the resources needed for the ambitious project the University turned to its most magnanimous benefactress, Mary Reed, who was known as “Denver’s Lady Bountiful.” Having already donated the impressive sum of $200,000 for the construction of the Margery Reed Hall in honor of her daughter, Mary Reed provided an additional $500,000 for the library project and a related endowment A portrait of Mary Reed now hangs in the DuPont Room in Mary Reed to commemorate her generosity.
 
   Noted Denver architect Harry J. Manning led the Mary Reed Library design team. The University had decided that it wanted to maintain the same Collegiate Gothic aesthetic that had shaped Margery Reed Hall as they developed the new library. As a result the design team used similar building materials, including rose-colored bricks and Indiana limestone. A crucial decision was the placement of the library. Although some wanted to maintain the open view of the front range to the west between University Hall and the Iliff School of Theology, the University ultimately chose to follow the Jeffersonian model from the University of Virginia: place the library at the highest and most prominent site on campus.  Another feature of the building was its floor plan: an “H” shape allowed natural light to fill the building during the day. The new building provided the University with all of the facilities needed for its central library: space for 400,000 volumes, “spacious reading rooms, customized furniture designed by the building’s architect, numerous exhibit rooms for archaeology and art displays, mullioned bay windows, wrought-iron railings with aluminum caps, exhibit cases, and a distinctive clustering of cathedral lights.” The building was dedicated over three days during the fall of 1932.

   The Mary Reed Library would serve as the main campus library for 40 years. By the 1960s however it was already clear that the university needed an even larger library. When Penrose Library was constructed in 1972 as the successor to Mary Reed the University found that Mary Reed was easily adaptable to other uses. Today the building houses many administrative offices such as the Chancellor’s office, Provost’s office, and Human Resources. Efforts to modify the building have been minimal, and the marble floors, Renaissance-style woodwork and Gothic-style windows remain. Recently the University demonstrated its commitment to the future of the building by funding an extensive tuck-pointing project that will replace much of the mortar on the structure 

Penrose Library is the current main library at the University. Completed in 1972 as the successor to Mary Reed Library, it broke with all previous architectural styles on the DU campus. By the time the unique looking library opened in 1972, the University desperately needed the additional space for its growing book collections. The El Pomar Foundation provided the necessary funds for the building’s construction, and the library was named after Spencer Penrose, the man who had started the foundation with his wife in 1937. Penrose made his fortune by investing in Colorado mining at the turn of the 20th century and the El Pomar Foundation was an effort to give back to Colorado. Not only was the $4.5 million gift the largest in the history of the El Pomar Foundation at that time but it was also the largest single gift that the University had ever received from a foundation. The simple square layout guaranteed ease of use for the library’s visitors. Beyond that Penrose Library was quite different. The main colors on the inside of the building were bright yellow, bright orange, bright red and not-so-bright purple. The seats were unique as well: doughnut chairs, pod chairs and even carpeted formations upon which one could climb.

   Penrose Library has changed greatly over the past 35 years to meet the changing needs of students. In the 1980s, the University replaced the old card catalogue with a new computer catalogue. Subtler colors have taken the place of the old vivid warm hues, although they do still remain in some places. Many of the older chairs have been replaced by more functional counterparts. Several outside services have found a home at Penrose Library as well: the Quick Copy Center, the Center for Teaching and Learning, the University Technology Services Help Center, multiple computer labs, and even a new coffee station. Wireless internet access is also available throughout the building. Today, the library’s collection contains well over a million books. Considering all that it offers, Penrose Library fulfills its mission of enabling “the members of the University community to use information resources creatively, analytically and critically toward the acquisition of knowledge.”
	
   Penrose Library will probably remain the main library at the University for decades to come. Although the building will undergo extensive redesign work in the near future it will surely maintain the spirit of service to the university community that it has displayed for the past 35 years.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Abstract>KCFR (Colorado Free Radio), 90.1 FM was established by the University of Denver, Denver, Colorado in 1970. The All University Student Association (AUSA) Senate provided the majority of the funding. The station was operated by a Radio Board and was staffed by students in order to offer hands-on experience in radio production. KCFR published two monthly publications, Wasteland and Selections. In 1973, KCFR became a National Public Radio (NPR) affiliate. In 1984, KCFR separated from the University of Denver and the station license was transferred to a community board of directors; the station became part of Colorado Public Radio.

Spanning the years of 1964 to 1981, the records of the KCFR radio station, a University of Denver established station, relate to its business operations.  Containing financial documents and news releases, they reflect the history and growth of the station from a tiny, ten watt production to an independent National Public Radio affiliate which is still in operation today.</Abstract>

The station was operated by a Radio Board and was staffed by students in order to offer hands-on experience in radio production. KCFR published two monthly publications, Wasteland and Selections. In 1973, KCFR became a National Public Radio (NPR) affiliate. In 1984, KCFR separated from the University of Denver and the station license was transferred to a community board of directors; the station became part of Colorado Public Radio.

Spanning the years of 1964 to 1981, the records of the KCFR radio station, a University of Denver established station, relate to its business operations.  Containing financial documents and news releases, they reflect the history and growth of the station from a tiny, ten watt production to an independent National Public Radio affiliate which is still in operation today.</Abstract_Abstract_Note>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __KCFR, Colorado Free Radio, 90.1FM, began official operation in November 1970.  Established by the University of Denver, it was staffed by students desiring hands-on experience in radio production.  The station first operated at ten watts, with three salaried employees and 24 volunteers.  During its history it published two monthly publications, Wasteland and Selections.  Wayne Roth was the general manager of the station from 1970 to 1978.  He moved on to become the Associate Director of Radio for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in Washington, D.C.  Max Wycisk replaced Roth in July 1978 after serving as KCFR's program director for the previous five years.  In time, KCFR grew to become a highly professional and socially effective station despite its limited funding.  In 1973, the Federal Communications Commission granted the station permission to expand to 30,000 watts.  This power increase qualified KCFR to become a National Public Radio (NPR) affiliate. In 1984, the station separated its affiliation from the University of Denver when its license was transfered to its community board of directors.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>Through the National Defense Act of 1916, the U.S. Congress authorized the formation of a Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) to help supply the leadership the army would need in the event of a sudden involvement in a large scale war. Students enrolling in ROTC units, which were to be established on a voluntary basis at colleges nationwide, would receive instruction in military subjects in addition to their normal academic studies. Upon graduation they would be awarded reserve officers' commissions.  The University of Denver participated in this first phase of training with 566 men, 15 of whom were killed in combat and 18 wounded.

T __In 1918 the ROTC was replaced by a more formal relationship between the military and the university, called the Students' Army Training Corp (S.A.T.C.).  At that time Colonel John C. Gresham, U.S. Army Retired, was appointed by the War Department as Professor of Military Science and Tactics.  The S.A.T.C. was divided into five platoons, with the 5th being a unit of the Naval Reserve.  Professor Etienne B. Renaud was a battalion commander and Professors Ira E. Cutler and David S. Duncan were instructors.  

There were 400 men inducted into the S.A.T.C. over its short duration at the University.  They lived in barracks, trained and attended college classes.  A building was erected adjacent to the gymnasium that served as a hospital.  That building was too small for the number of influenza cases during the epidemic of 1918-1919, when cases were transferred to the ''Aurora Hospital.''  

The S.A.T.C. unit has barely begun when events in Europe signaled that the war would soon be over.  The first orders to stop accepting new recruits came in early November 1918.  All of the University of Denver S.A.T.C. members had been demobilized or transferred by early 1919.</Bio_Org_History>
      <Bio_Org_History_Bio._Expansion>In 1918 the ROTC was replaced by a more formal relationship between the military and the university, called the Students' Army Training Corp (S.A.T.C.).  At that time Colonel John C. Gresham, U.S. Army Retired, was appointed by the War Department as Professor of Military Science and Tactics.  The S.A.T.C. was divided into five platoons, with the 5th being a unit of the Naval Reserve.  Professor Etienne B. Renaud was a battalion commander and Professors Ira E. Cutler and David S. Duncan were instructors.  

There were 400 men inducted into the S.A.T.C. over its short duration at the University.  They lived in barracks, trained and attended college classes.  A building was erected adjacent to the gymnasium that served as a hospital.  That building was too small for the number of influenza cases during the epidemic of 1918-1919, when cases were transferred to the ''Aurora Hospital.''  

The S.A.T.C. unit has barely begun when events in Europe signaled that the war would soon be over.  The first orders to stop accepting new recruits came in early November 1918.  All of the University of Denver S.A.T.C. members had been demobilized or transferred by early 1919.</Bio_Org_History_Bio._Expansion>
      <Bio_Org_History_Biograph._History>Through the National Defense Act of 1916, the U.S. Congress authorized the formation of a Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) to help supply the leadership the army would need in the event of a sudden involvement in a large scale war. Students enrolling in ROTC units, which were to be established on a voluntary basis at colleges nationwide, would receive instruction in military subjects in addition to their normal academic studies. Upon graduation they would be awarded reserve officers' commissions.  The University of Denver participated in this first phase of training with 566 men, 15 of whom were killed in combat and 18 wounded.

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __In 1931 a group of University of Denver faculty women and wives of faculty members, who had been meeting informally for several years, formalized the group as the Faculty Wives of the Arts College.  A like-minded group of female professors was called the Faculty Ladies Club of the downtown School of the University of Denver.  September 19, 1935 the two groups merged to form the Women’s Faculty Club. __After the merger, the Women’s Faculty Club expanded its membership to wives of ROTC and Aviation Training personnel.  Subgroups were organized for special interests, including Book Review, Contract Bridge, and Square Dancing, among others.  A Student Loan Fund was established, with funds raised at a Bridge Benefit at the Daniels and Fisher Tearoom.  During the War years, the group’s efforts were directed to such activities as Red Cross work, War Bonds, and U.S.O. events.

After the war there was a period of growth, both in the University population in general, fueled by the GI Bill, and in the faculty.  The Women’s Faculty Club expanded to include the wives of students, then secretaries and administrative assistants were invited to join.  New activities were initiated, including the Craft Guild, Fall Picnic, and Christmas Party.  During the 1950s the membership continued to expand as membership was extended to University Trustees’ wives, and the wives of Iliff Faculty.  The Women’s Faculty Club began supporting other campus activities, such as the Center for Students from Abroad, Student Health Services.  An annual D.U. Night at Central City Opera was added to the sponsored events.

The year 1964 was the centennial year for the University of Denver, and the decade of the 1960s saw an emphasis on historical aspects of the organization.  The War Bonds in which the organization had invested matured and were placed in a Centennial Fund which was used for such things as the improvement of the Phipps Conference Center and Buchtel House.  Buchtel House became the permanent meeting place for the organization in 1963. 

In 1981 the Constitution and By-Laws of the Women’s Faculty Club were revised and the name was changed to The University of Denver Women’s Club.  The change recognized the fact that the organization had grown far beyond the original faculty wives.</Bio_Org_History>

However there always seems to be some discrepancy as to exact dates and names.  As time has passed pieces of the history have been lost and speculation has replaced fact.  That said, it is known for sure that the very first paper published at the University of Denver was the Weekly Peanut in 1882.  Only four issues were ever put out and they were all done by hand.  Following the Weekly Peanut the Hesperus appeared in approximately 1886 and was around until the advent of the Bulletin (sometime in the 1890's) , which came out as a rival causing the Hesperus to go under.  In 1899 the name of the Bulletin was changed to the Denver University Clarion, which it has been known as since then.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Arrang_Organiz>The Student Protests are organized into three series:  1.  Student Protests, General.  2.  1968 Sit-In.  3.  Woodstock West.</Arrang_Organiz>
      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The University of Denver has experienced protests by students since early in its history.  Most of the early protests were about University issues, such as disciplinary actions or tuition increases.  Later protests were generally about national and international issues, joining national student protest movements. __The earliest protest relates to a 1911 strike by students in support of twenty members of the Junior class disciplined for rioting at a school event.  The latest in the collection is about the Gulf War of 1991.  In between, students protested such issues as tuition hikes or against a preacher who opposed Kennedy's election because he was Catholic.

As with most Universities, the majority of the protests happened in the 1960s and 1970s, when the Vietnam War and the draft were the focus.  There was a major sit-in in 1968 which began with protests of recruitment on campus by the CIA and Dow Chemical, but expanded to encompass a general Student Bill of Rights allowing students to determine policies on student governance.

The most well-known protest happened in 1970, when students erected Woodstock West on the Carnegie Green as part of a national student strike protesting the killing of students at Kent State by National Guard troops.  The student body and faculty were split between supporters of the strike and those who stood behind Chancellor Mitchell as he demanded the cessation of protest.  The police were called, the shanties were pulled down only to be rebuilt.  Finally the National Guard were called in and Woodstock West was dismantled peacefully.  

After Woodstock West, the energy left the protest movements. There were small protests over the Iranian takeover of the US Embassy in Tehran, the Tienemen (Tiananmen, Tienanmen, Tien'an Men) Square in China and the Gulf War in 1991.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The Iota Chapter of Sigma Kappa Sorority was established at the University of Denver in Denver, Colorado, on February 21, 1908. It was the first Sigma Kappa chapter to be chartered west of the Mississippi River, and only the ninth chapter chartered since the founding of the sorority at Colby College (Waterville, Maine) in 1874. Students at the University of Denver attempted to form a chapter in 1906, but lacked sufficient funds. In the winter of 1907-1908 the Grand President of Sigma Kappa, Sara B. Mathews, visited Denver and recommended that the charter be granted. 

Financial struggles of the organization and health problems of the members limited the growth of the Chapter in its early years. However, five years after the Chapter was founded, it gained enough strength to host the 39th Convention of the Sigma Kappa Sorority. The convention was successful, with Iota Chapter offering sorority sisters Western hospitality, fun and community.

The Chapter was involved in a variety of philanthropic activities. Its primary beneficiary was the Maine Sea Coast Mission, and in later years the Chapter also helped Alzheimer's patients. The Chapter members were involved in many University activities, and strove to maintain high academic standards.

In the 1930s, the Iota Chapter acquired a house for its members. The Sigma Kappa House at 2258 S. Josephine was constructed in 1932. It was purchased by the University in 1960 and renamed for Mrs. Rollie Bradford, a Sigma Kappa alumna and member of the University of Denver Board of Trustees. 

The Iota Chapter had 35 members in 1966, and encountered financial difficulties. The National Council of Sigma Kappa decided to close the Chapter in October 1967, although they left open the possibility of reinstating the Chapter in the future. It was not until 1988, however, that enough interest was generated to reorganize the Chapter. At that time the University invited Sigma Kappa to reopen their Iota Chapter. In 1993, the Chapter was again experiencing financial problems as they graduated their largest class ever. Members began sacrificing class commitments to keep the Chapter open, and it was decided to close the Chapter. On May 14, 1993, the members of Iota Chapter voted to release the National Charter it had received when it reopened five years before.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Abstract>The Faculty Senate at the University of Denver was established in 1932. Its purpose is to give faculty a voice in University policies and procedures, especially concerning the faculty. The Senate is responsible for setting faculty personnel policies, including salary guidelines, sabbatical leave, faculty review and tenure.  The Faculty Senate records consist of the working documents and administrative materials of the organization from its inception through 1999. The bulk of the collection consists of materials from the 1970's through the 1990's. Further accruals are expected. As the Faculty Senate is an active body of the University and continues to produce sensitive documentation, much of the collection is restricted. Only qualified researchers are permitted to review the records. Please contact the Curator of Special Collections &amp; Archives directly for access permission. __Initially called the University Senate, it was formed to address matters of faculty salary and budget deficits that the University faced during the early years of the Depression.  Although the composition of the Senate has changed over the years, its purpose has always remained the same.  The documents in the collection consist of reports, memos, letters, agendas, meeting minutes and hand-written notes from full Senate meetings and Senate committee meetings, Senate membership lists, the Senate Constitution and By-laws, and faculty handbooks. The collection includes materials concerning faculty requests for sabbatical leave, personnel policies, faculty evaluations of administrators, and faculty salary evaluations and policies.

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The Faculty Senate at the University of Denver was established in 1932. Initially called the University Senate, it was formed to address matters of faculty salary and budget deficits that the University faced during the early years of the Depression.  Although the composition of the Senate has changed over the years, its purpose has always been to give faculty a voice in University policies and procedures, especially concerning the faculty. The Senate is responsible for setting faculty personnel policies, including salary guidelines, sabbatical leave, faculty review and tenure. __When the Faculty Senate was formed, it consisted of all faculty members of full professional rank, all members of the Board of Trustees and administrative officers of the University. Members felt that they were not adequately consulted in matters of salary and budget decisions and the Senate was formed in part to rectify the situation. The Faculty Senate has responsibility for setting faculty personnel policies, including salary guidelines, sabbatical leave, faculty review and tenure. The Honors Committee of the Senate awards the Distinguished Teacher Award and the University Lecturer for each year, as well as honorary degrees. The Senate was instrumental in the creation of the Core Curriculum, development of policies regarding domestic partner benefits, and was involved in the decision to become a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I school. Over the years the Senate has also been involved in situations affecting the entire University. For example, the ad-hoc Committee on Student Unrest was formed in 1969 to address the student concerns that led to the “Woodstock West” action in 1970.  The composition of the Faculty Senate has changed over the years. In 1947, the Senate consisted of the chancellor, six trustees, including the president of the board, 12 administrators, 15 full professors, 11 associate professors, ten assistant professors, nine instructors, and three part-time faculty, a total of 67 members. The Chancellor was the ex-officio President of the Senate. The Vice President and the Secretary were elected annually, one of which was to be a trustee and the other a faculty member. The standing committees of the Senate included committees on budget, academic policy, personnel, honorary degrees, and nominations.  In 1952 the Senate Constitution was amended again. The composition of the body now included the chancellor, 12 other administrators, and 48 full-time faculty of all tenured ranks. The Chancellor no longer served as president of the Senate. Six ex-officio members of the Board of Trustees were included and obtained floor privileges but no voting rights. The President, Vice President and Secretary were elected annually by the Senate membership. An Executive Committee was added to the standing committees. It consisted of the President, Vice President, Secretary, and the chairs of the other standing committees. A Committee on Instruction and Curriculum and a Research Committee were added, presumably to replace the Academic Policy Committee, which was dropped. A Committee on Student Life was also added.  In 1955 the Board of Trustees membership was eliminated from the Faculty Senate. A Financial Planning Committee was added in 1967. By 1971 the membership of the Senate was expanded to include representatives from the Denver Research Institute and the Library. The Constitution was amended again in 1974, when representatives from the undergraduate and graduate student body were added. A number of standing committees were also added or changed in 1974. The Committee on Student Life became the Committee on Student Affairs, and committees on Computer Policy, Faculty Review, Library Policy, and Sabbatical Leave were added. In 1976 the Bookstore Policy Committee was added. Representatives from the Department of Athletics were added in 1984.  In 1986 the standing committees were reorganized once again. The committees on Instruction and Curriculum and Research were folded into an Academic Planning Committee. This committee was also charged with computer planning and library policies. The duties of the Faculty Review Committee and the Sabbatical Leave Committee were assigned to the Personnel Committee. Bookstore management and policy was assigned to the Committee on Student and Alumni Affairs.  During the 1980's the administration's representation to the Senate was decreased. In 1986 only the Vice-Chancellors for Academic Affairs and Research were given membership in the Senate. The standing committees continued to work with the administration in their respective areas of concern. As of the fall of 2002, the Senate membership consisted of approximately 50 members representing all the academic units.</Bio_Org_History>
