The center served to bring cultural and educational opportunities to all segments of the Jewish community: It provided activities such as English classes for immigrants and literary and musical programs. The center moved to a large mansion at 1601 Irving Street in 1937, which acted as the west branch of the JCC until it was sold in 1967 to the Boy's Club.

      <Bio_Org_History>The Jewish Consumptives' Relief Society (JCRS) was founded in Denver, Colorado, in 1904 as a non-sectarian sanatorium to treat tuberculosis (TB) patients in all stages of the disease. The society was founded by a group of immigrant Eastern European Jewish men, many of whom were themselves victims of TB.  For decades patients flocked to Denver from all over the country and were admitted free of charge. In the early years, the sanatorium was headed by Dr. Charles Spivak as secretary (1904-1927) and by Philip Hillkowitz as president (1904-1948). The facility catered primarily to Jewish patients in a distinctively Jewish environment. In 1954 the institution changed its mission to cancer research and became the American Medical Center. Today it is known as the AMC Cancer Research Center.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The National Council of Jewish Women was founded in 1893 by Hannah G. Solomon at the Parliament of Religions of the Chicago World's Fair. Among the other women at the World's Fair was Carrie Benjamin, who returned home to Denver, Colorado, and organized the Council's Denver Section in October, 1893. Most of the early members were from Temple Emanuel in Denver. Education was an early priority of the Denver Section, and classes were held to serve the needs of Eastern European Jewish immigrants in the West Colfax area. The Denver Section established a Settlement House in West Denver for Jewish boys, worked with disabled children, and began the Children's Traveling Theatre. The Denver Section legislative committee actively supported progressive legislation. During World War II, the Denver Section was very involved in the resettlement of Jewish refugees in the Denver area. In 1938 the Denver Section opened a Thrift Shop at Twenty-Seventh St. and Welton St. in Five Points.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __For many years Denver faced a serious social problem when hundreds of people severely ill with tuberculosis, also known as the “White Plague,” converged on the city, attracted by the reputation Denver had already acquired as the “world's sanatorium.” Because of the onslaught of consumptives, beds for patients in city and state general hospitals were so scarce that the poor were frequently left to their own devices, often dying in the streets. In 1899 the Jewish community, propelled by the concept of Gemilas Chasodim (acts of kindness), erected National Jewish Hospital (NJH), the first sanatorium in Denver for tuberculosis victims. With the financial assistance of the International Order of B'nai B'rith, the hospital opened its doors to Jews and gentiles alike. In accordance with contemporary wisdom, the NJH adopted a program that emphasized the benefits of fresh air, good nutrition, and rest. Many early prominent physicians were associated with the hospital, including Dr. Saling Simon, Dr. Robert Levy, and Dr. John Elsner.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __In 1903, Ira C. Rothgerber, Sr., and Walter Appel became law partners and opened their own law firm, Rothgerber &amp; Appel, in Denver, Colorado. During its first 25 years, the firm concentrated on collections and bankruptcy. Rothgerber's son, Ira Rothergerber, Jr., became a partner in the firm in 1941, and Appel's son Robert Appel became a partner in 1952. The firm gained renown in the 1950s when it successfully defended, on appeal, a group of Denverites charged with communist affiliations under the Sedition Act. In 1963 the firm became involved in banking when it helped to found what is now known as FirstBank. In 1985 the firm changed its name to Rothgerber, Appel, Powers &amp; Johnson, and in 1998 the firm added Lyons to its name in recognition of lawyer Jim Lyons. Today the firm is known as Rothgerber Johnson &amp; Lyons LLP and is one of the ten largest legal partnerships in Colorado.

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __Samsonite Corporation, the world-famous maker of luggage, started in Denver, Colorado, in 1910, when Jesse Shwayder opened a small luggage factory in Denver with his father, Isaac Shwayder, and brothers, Mark, Maurice, Benjamin, and Solomon Shwayder. The operation became incorporated as the Shwayder Trunk Manufacturing Company in 1912 and counted many members of the Shwayder family among its employees. All of the Shwayder brothers held executive positions in the company in the 1920s: Jesse was the company's president, Mark Shwayder was in charge of sales, Maurice and Ben Shwayder were in charge of manufacturing, and Solomon Shwayder served as the company’s lawyer. Samson was the first trade name for the company’s luggage, and this was later changed to Samsonite. Shwayder Trunk Manufacturing Company started to diversify its product offerings in the 1930s by manufacturing folding furniture, and the company changed its name to Shwayder Brothers, Inc., in 1931. As sales increased throughout the 20th century, the company moved into gradually larger facilities in Denver, and at various stages in the business’ history it opened additional plants in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Arizona, Mexico, and Japan.  In 1961, Jesse Shwayder’s son King D. Shwayder became president of the company, and in 1965 the Shwayder Brothers, Inc., changed its name to Samsonite Corporation. The corporation continues to operate in the 21st century.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>The Shwayder family of Denver, Colorado, is best known for the luggage company Samsonite Corporation, which was founded and operated by the family over the course of the 20th century. The Denver Shwayders can be traced to Abraham Kobesky and Miriam Rachofsky of Poland, who married and later migrated to Manchester, England (where the name ''Kobesky'' was shortened to ''Kobey''). Their daughter Rachel Kobey married Isaac Shwayder, who had also migrated to Manchester from Eastern Europe. Rachel and Isaac Shwayder had 11 children: Solomon, Dora, Jesse, Raschelle, Mark, Gertrude, Florence, Maurice, Hannah, Benjamin, and Liebe. Having been persuaded by his wife's pioneering uncle Abe Rachofsky and great uncle Alexander Rittmaster, Isaac Shwayder first came to Central City, Colorado, in 1879 to find work, and after two years the rest of his family joined him. The Shwayders later moved to Nevadaville (Black Hawk), Colorado, and in 1888 they settled in Denver, where Isaac Shwayder owned a grocery store and later started a second-hand furniture business. The Shwayder children attended Franklin School and West High School in Denver, and Solomon Shwayder, the oldest brother, attended the University of Denver. In 1910 Jesse Shwayder opened a small luggage factory in Denver with his father, Isaac, and brothers, Mark, Maurice, Benjamin, and Solomon. The business became incorporated as the Shwayder Trunk Manufacturing Company in 1912, and it eventually changed its name to Samsonite Corporation. Isaac Shwayder died of a stroke in 1916. Most of the Shwayder siblings held executive positions in the family business. In 1961, Jesse Shwayder’s son King Shwayder became president of the Samsonite Corporation.</Bio_Org_History>

There Isaac Shwayder married Rachel Kobey. Isaac Shwayder first came to Central City, Colorado, in 1879 to find work, and after two years the rest of his family joined him. Rachel and Isaac Shwayder had 11 children: Solomon, Dora, Jesse, Raschelle, Mark, Gertrude, Florence, Maurice, Hannah, Benjamin, and Liebe.  The Shwayders moved from Central City to Nevadaville (Black Hawk), Colorado, and in 1888 they settled in Denver, where Isaac Shwayder owned a grocery store and later started a second-hand furniture business. In 1910 Jesse Shwayder opened a small luggage factory in Denver with his father, Isaac, and brothers, Mark, Maurice, Benjamin, and Solomon. The business became incorporated as the Shwayder Trunk Manufacturing Company in 1912, and it eventually changed its name to Samsonite Corporation. Isaac Shwayder died of a stroke in 1916.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The Jewish Family and Children’s Service of Colorado (JFCS) was created in a response to international, national, and local needs of refugees.  The JFCS emerged from two organizations, the National Council of Jewish Women, Denver Section (NCJW), founded in 1893 and the Central Jewish Aid Society of Denver, Colorado, organized in 1915 and incorporated in 1923. Ray David was the first superintendent of the Jewish Aid Society. In 1937, Tillye Levy became a member of the Service to Foreign Born Committee of the NCJW and immediately began organizing resources for Jews who fled the early stages of the Holocaust. The services supplied facilitated the adjustment of the refugees. At Tillye Levy’s request, Isadore Hilb became the first chair of the new Denver Coordinating Committee for Refugees. A. B. Hirshfield was the chair of the job placement committee, Dave Harlem was in charge of creating affidavits, and Surriee Feder Miller was responsible for integrating newcomers into the Denver community. In 1947, the Jewish Family and Children’s Service was created when the boards of the Central Jewish Aid Society and the NCJW committees merged. Sydney Grossman became the newly formed agency’s first president, and Dr. Alfred Neumann, a social worker, became the full-time director. The name was changed to the Jewish Family and Children's Service of Denver in 1954 and became the Jewish Family and Children's Service of Colorado in 1972. The JFCS continued to give relief to the needy and assist refugees in resettling, but also expanded into the field of family and child welfare. The JFCS created the “Denver Plan,” procedures for integrating new residents into the community, which was copied by cities across the United States. The agency hired trained staff to provide service in three areas: family, child, and vocational guidance; service to established residents; and immigrant aid. The agency also handled German reparation money through the Utility Workshop, headed by Mary (Mrs. Sidney) Jacobs. The Utility Workshop produced jobs and services for individuals suffering from emotional or physical handicaps. The services provided by the JFCS continue on through its successor, the Jewish Family Service of Colorado.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Scope-Content>Series 3 of 6 consists primarily of annual convention syllabi produced for the Universal Round Dance Council and International Choreographed Ballroom Dance Association, dating from the first convention.  Syllabi are present for 1977-2007 in physical form and 1977-2012 as PDFs on CD (which includes the 1978-2012 newsletters as well).  Also included are some ephemera items, mostly daily convention programs, and a newspaper clipping about the 2001 convention in San Jose, CA.  
Convention syllabi include content such as letters from hosting mayors and the current organization president, committee names and pictures, lists of board members and committee chairs, award notices, top dance lists, biographies with photos of teachers, complete program descriptions and schedules, names of performance groups, vendor lists, clinic workshop notes.  Much of each syllabus is devoted to cue sheets for popular dances to be done at the convention.

      <Scope-Content>The Anton Kremer Scrapbook is a collection of post cards.  Many of the postcards are simply for display, and include images from Scotland, Ireland, England, and Rome.  Some of the postcards depict art work, others the crowned heads of Europe.  Finally, there are postcards that were sent to Anton Kremer in Denver, Colorado.  These appear to be of family groups and European scenes.  Some of the postcards are in German.</Scope-Content>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The University of Denver Arena/Field House complex was home to the University’s athletics programs for nearly five decades, from 1948 through 1997. Most famous for housing the school’s hockey, swimming and basketball programs, the DU Arena and Field House had a proud history.

At the conclusion of World War II, the University needed to expand its athletic facilities to meet the substantial influx in veterans attending the institution. The old Alumni Gym simply would not suffice. DU ended up finding an inexpensive solution that involved veterans, albeit somewhat indirectly. The University was able to acquire a drill hall from Farragut Naval Base in Idaho and moved it to Denver. The federal government had originally ordered the base built almost overnight during World War II.  Soon after the end of the war the government decommissioned the base. After disassembling and transporting the structure, the construction teams began to transform the old drill hall into the new home of DU athletics. Three separate structures actually made up the DU Arena and Field House. The South End held classrooms, a track and multi-purpose practice space. The Middle Section contained a state-of-the-art swimming pool. The North Arena eventually housed an ice hockey rink that could be converted into a basketball court. In the basement, there was even an area for a rifle team.

The University was able to do all of this work at a small fraction of the cost for a new building, thanks to the generosity of the federal government.

In 1972, after nearly 25 years of service, the University discovered serious structural problems in both the DU Arena and Field House. Heavy snowfall in December had caused a crack in one of the major roof support beams in the arena. For several months, DU athletic teams had to play in rented spaces, and the University pondered its next move. Did it make more sense to completely rebuild the structure or to safely reinforce it? The administration decided to build a new field house but to repair the old arena The University badly needed a building capable of hosting its large events, both athletic and non-athletic. After a great deal of effort, the University managed to open its athletic complex within just a couple of years. The new remodeled Field House provided more resources for students in physical education programs and additional practice courts for basketball. The unique painting scheme in the renovated ice arena quickly earned the facility a new nickname: the “Rainbow Ballroom.” Most importantly, the University once again had the large assembly space that it required for sporting events and school functions.

By the mid 1990s, the University realized that it was time to upgrade the arena and field house yet again. The “Old Barn” had served DU well for nearly 50 years, but a burning desire to raise all of the school’s athletics programs to the Division I level demanded the construction of a truly modern sports complex. In 1997, the demolition of the DU Arena and Field House began. Today, the Ritchie Center for Sports and Wellness stands on the same site that the arena and field house occupied for nearly 50 years.

Located next to Hilltop Stadium, the Arena and Field House nicely rounded out the athletic venues available to the University. Not only did the varsity teams finally have adequate space, but intramural programs and numerous local sports teams also benefited tremendously from the additional space. The highlight of those early years was capturing five NCAA ice hockey Championships under the guidance of Coach Murray Armstrong. Pioneer athletes finally had the indoor home that they deserved.  Although little remains to remind students of the DU Arena and Field House today, many generations of fans will never forget watching the Pioneers in the “Old Barn.” Seats from the arena and bricks from the field house were sold to commemorate past Pioneer glories. The proceeds helped the University raise the funds that it needed to begin a new era in the history of DU athletics with the construction of the Ritchie Center.</Bio_Org_History>

The proceeds helped the University raise the funds that it needed to begin a new era in the history of DU athletics with the construction of the Ritchie Center.</Bio_Org_History_Organiz._History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __Dedicated in 1963, the Boettcher Center for Science, Engineering and Research is the oldest building dedicated to science programs on the University of Denver campus today. When it was built, the Boettcher Center stood on the forefront of innovation in science building design.  The Boettcher Center is located on the South Side of Campus at 2050 East Iliff Avenue Denver, CO 80208.  

From the start of the planning process, DU wanted  its new science building to help reconcile the perceived rift in the academic community between theoretical science and applied science. Just as importantly, DU sought to develop a stronger reputation for the study of science and engineering in Denver.  This particular emphasis attracted the attention of the Boettcher Foundation. Incorporated in 1937 by Charles Boettcher and his son Claude with the stated purpose of promoting the State of Colorado, the Boettcher Foundation offered the University a grant in the amount of $1.25 million for the construction of a science facility. That donation represented a real precedent because until that time the organization had not really funded major construction projects.

The University broke ground for the new structure in 1961.  Housing a mixture of classrooms and offices, a technical library and a large auditorium, the building was eminently adaptable to a wide range of needs.   

The original plan for Boettcher called for eight buildings within a complex. Next to it stand two newer additions to DU science facilities, the Seeley G. Mudd Building and Olin Hall. However, Boettcher Center remains an important space for several of the science departments, the School of Engineering and Computer Science as well as the Department of Geography. Though the building clearly stands out today as a prime example of 1960s’ architecture, it is hard not to appreciate the innovation that went into its design at the time of construction. The reflecting pool in the main courtyard not only has aesthetic value: it is also a key part of the building’s coolant system. The Boettcher Center held the first computer on the DU campus. However, even more important than the building itself was its impact on the quality of the science programs at the University.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __Completed in 1917, Buchtel Chapel  was first called the Memorial Chapel in honor of those students who died serving their country during World War I. It was renamed in honor of Chancellor Buchtel in 1949.  Sadly, a fire destroyed the chapel in 1983, and only one of the original four towers, Buchtel Tower, stands today.  The one remaining tower is located behind Penrose Library at 2150 South Evans Avenue Denver, CO 80208.

Buchtel Chapel (Memorial Chapel) was constructed to provide the University of Denver with a chapel that could hold both large religious and secular assemblies.  It seemed fitting to recognize the sacrifices of those DU alumni who died serving their country during the Great War, and a bronze plaque honoring those men who lost their lives proudly adorned the north wall of Memorial Chapel.

The history of Buchtel Chapel began in 1907, when Methodists of the Colorado Conference started to collect funds for its construction. Although the cornerstone was laid just three years later, the chapel was not completed until 1917.

In 1949, the University’s administration decided to rename the Chapel after the Chancellor who had overseen its construction, the great Henry A. Buchtel.

The chapel’s exterior was a fusion of Moorish and Spanish Missionary influences. A tower stood at each of the building’s four corners, each one topped by an impressive copper dome. Despite the Methodist roots of the building, a tablet within the Chapel assured visitors of the ecumenical mission of the University. It reads “In hope that religious prejudices may vanish from the life of all Christian bodies.”  The philanthropist who donated the red bricks for the chapel’s exterior and the furnishings for its interior, J.K. Mullen, was a Roman Catholic. The Chapel also held numerous secular events, such as freshman assemblies and prominent guest lecturers. The Music School frequently employed the facility for classes, practice sessions and concerts. Buchtel Chapel was also a favorite for alumni gatherings. During its time on campus, the Chapel was certainly one of the most recognizable and meaningful buildings on campus, a constant through years of tremendous change at the school. Two of the more well known objects owned by the University lived in the chapel: a copy of the Sistine Madonna done by the famous copyist Hermann Till and a donated pipe organ.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __Chamberlin Observatory is one of the oldest and most well known buildings associated with the University of Denver. Built in 1891, the Observatory is recognized as a National Historic Landmark. The facility continues to serve the needs of DU students as well as those of the surrounding community: the original 20-inch refractor telescope is still functional today.  Chamberlin Observatory is located at 2930 East Warren Avenue 80208 east of the main University of Denver campus.

The story of the origins of Chamberlin Observatory is one of personal commitment. Herbert Howe, the University’s first astronomer, knew that his young academic program needed a large telescope. When Humphrey Chamberlin, an amateur astronomer, inquired if Howe would be interested in purchasing a telescope with his financial assistance Howe leapt at the chance. Howe managed to obtain an instrument that cost $11,000, $5,000 coming from Chamberlin. In order to fully protect this new investment, Howe rode with the lens for the entire train journey from Cambridge, Massachusetts to Denver, Colorado.

Although Howe handed over control of the observatory in 1928, he left a legacy of extended and dedicated service for those who have followed. His immediate successor, a professor from the Math Department named Albert Recht, believed that the observatory had an important role to play for the surrounding community: he wanted astronomy to be within the reach of everyone. DU staff member Francis Ohmer became the next man to hold the Astronomer position in 1968, and a strong partnership with the Denver Astronomical Society began to develop. The third Director of the observatory was Professor Edgar Everhart, who gained wide recognition for his research on comets and atomic physics. During his tenure the Observatory received its designation as a National Historic Landmark. For several years after Everhart stepped down in 1985, the position remained vacant.  However, a generous $3.75 million donation from benefactor William Womble, who received his BA from DU in 1934, stipulated that DU fund a new Astronomy chair.

One of the West’s most prominent architects, Robert Roeschlaub, had already designed a beautiful Richardsonian-style building to properly house the new telescope. Howe finally realized his dream when the instrument was installed in 1894.  

During the summer of 2008, DU launched a major restoration project that will ensure the preservation of the Observatory for another century

The current Astronomer, Robert Stencel, became the first Womble Professor of Astronomy in 1994, and the Observatory had a Director once again.  Since taking charge of the observatory, Stencel has worked diligently to preserve it for future generations. First he managed to place the Observatory on the Denver Historic Landmark list. Then he moved quickly to secure a $100,000 emergency grant to stabilize the observatory’s weakened walls and roof. In addition to his impressive work with Chamberlin Observatory, Stencel has also transformed the Astronomy program at DU. He took the lead in the development of the world-class Meyer-Womble Observatory which now sits atop Mount Evans.  Chamberlin Observatory still functions today, for both DU students and the surrounding community. Public viewings continue each month weather permitting.  It is estimated that 250,000 people have looked through DU telescopes since Howe first introduced the Astronomy program in 1880. This figure would easily make star-gazing one of the favorite pastimes of the DU community.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The Daniels College of Business building houses the business programs at the University of Denver. Built in 1999, it stands as a testament to the unique, inspirational vision of its benefactor, Bill Daniels.  The Daniel’s College of Business is located at  2101 South University Boulevard, Denver, Colorado 80208.

By the late 1980s, the eighth oldest collegiate business school in the nation needed a new home. After being located downtown for several decades, the program had moved to the College of Business Administration Building (a part of what is now Sturm Hall). However, the legendary philanthropist Bill Daniels wanted to see not only a new building for the business school, but a bold new direction for the program as a whole. According to Built for Learning, “his goal was to create a business school that stressed ethics and values, while also preparing students to become better business and community leaders.” Essentially he wanted to see a curriculum that stressed integrity.  In 1995, he provided the University with a grant worth $11 million (after having also donated $11 million several years beforehand) to construct a new building. With the funds in hand (the project ended up costing about $25 million), the challenge became designing the right type of building.

University architect Cabell “Cab” Childress sought ways in which to create the bold environment Daniels had pictured, and also realized that he had to work to integrate this new building into an existing architectural aesthetic. 

Located at the eastern gateway to campus, the site for the Daniels College of Business building stood right next to Margery Reed Hall and University Hall, both very distinct in terms of their exterior styling. However, Childress saw Daniels’ request for a two-wing building as an opportunity to establish a unified architectural vision: making each wing correspond with its neighboring building. As a result the northern portion of the building employs modest ornamentation to complement the classic Collegiate Gothic styling of Margery Reed Hall. The southern portion of the college has a roofline that Childress measured to follow the pitch of its counterpart at University Hall. Equally-detailed considerations went into the development of the interior of the building. The materials employed in the construction process, like “Appalachian rift-sawn white oak trim and Welsh quarry floor tiles” were meant to create a warm and welcoming environment. 

Another challenge facing Childress and his team involved finding the ideal design for the college’s classrooms: they wanted more than the traditional lecture hall. Inspired by the “case method” approach to business education at the University of Virginia, those in the Daniels administration and faculty wanted classrooms that would facilitate a high degree of interaction between the student and the professor. The result was the “case room,” which Childress designed with a wide center aisle and a more rounded look, allowing a professor to move more easily among the students and to establish eye contact with any student. One of the centerpieces of the Daniels College of Business is Marcus Commons, a pleasant gathering place for business students. It also welcomes those from outside the business school as well: Childress wanted the Daniels building to be an inclusive addition to the University of Denver campus. Perhaps the most impressive feature of the Daniels College of Business building is how it blends the old and the new: built to last for centuries through the use of time-tested construction materials and methods, it also features technological flexibility that allows it to adapt to changing technological needs over time.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The William T. Driscoll Student Center at the University of Denver provides the University community with a focal point that meets a variety of needs. With a pedestrian walkway that passes over Evans Avenue to join north and south buildings, the Driscoll Center is also one of the most recognizable structures on campus. The Center serves a wide range of university functions but it remains a student center first and foremost.  The William T. Driscoll Student Center is located at 2050 East Evans Ave. 80208.

By the late 1970s it was clear that the University needed a modern student center. The old Student Union building was inadequate did little to attract prospective students. The planning process for a replacement began but initial development was delayed by the controversial issue of funding the project with increased student activity fees. Despite the procedural disputes the University community as a whole understood that DU desperately needed a new student center.

In 1984 DU dedicated the new William T. Driscoll University Center. The unique and modern design was carried out by Denver architect Michael Barber.

The school finally had a building that provided “opportunities for social, recreational, cultural and informal intellectual experiences.” The final plan involved remodeling the old Student Union building to the south, creating a new building to the north and joining them with a pedestrian bridge. The structure provided the University with a wide range of services including student organization offices, an information desk, a recreation center, a ballroom, a bookstore, and a pub. One of the most impressive features of the structure was its internal bridge spanning Evans Avenue. This gave DU students a safer alternative to crossing Evans Avenue than at street level. 
 
It was the All Undergraduate Student Association Senate that had first suggested naming the structure after Dr. William (Bill) Driscoll. A beloved professor, William T. Driscoll served the University for over 30 years. Although he also served as an administrator his true love was working with students, whether teaching or advising. Today, the DU Outstanding Faculty Award is named in his honor.
 
Today’s William T. Driscoll Student Center still has a bookstore, a general dining area, a set of student offices, and a pub, but all have undergone substantial modifications over the years. Sidelines Pub, Jazzman’s Café and Grill on the Greens were all shaped by student suggestions. The building still acts as the center point of the DU campus. It connects the two sides of campus both practically and aesthetically. Outside organization frequently rent out the Driscoll Ballroom.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __Margery Reed Hall, completed over 75 years ago, serves many institutional needs for the University of Denver today, housing a wide variety of classes and the Department of Theatre.  Margery Reed is located at 2306 East Evans Avenue Denver, CO 80208.

The only building at the University named after a student, Margery Reed Hall is the manifestation of a mother’s love for her daughter and that daughter’s love for her university. Margery Reed graduated from DU with a degree in English. She earned a position as an Assistant Professor in the same department. It was here that she met her future husband, Paul Mayo, also a DU alumnus and professor. Margery Reed cherished the time that she spent at the University. Tragically, upon returning from a trip to South America Margery Reed died from a disease that she had likely contracted during her travels. Mary Reed, the young woman’s mother, wanted to commemorate her daughter by giving back to the University that had given so much to Margery. Since her daughter had donated to the capital campaign for campus buildings shortly before her death, Mary Reed appropriately followed the same path. Eventually, the generous mother donated over $100,000 to the University to construct the Margery Reed Mayo Memorial Hall. The name would later be shortened to Margery Reed Hall because it was felt that common abbreviations such as Mayo Hall and Memorial Hall did not adequately honor the memory of Margery Reed.

The Collegiate Gothic structure was designed by Charles Z. Klauder, an architect famous for his work on college campuses throughout the nation. A plaque inside Margery Reed Hall explains that the building was dedicated to the memory of Margery Reed and the “Service of Youth in Quest of the Good Life”.

Dedicated in 1929, Margery Reed Hall is now the fourth oldest building at the University Park campus. Although the interior of the building has undergone several changes, it still houses the Little Theater and Department of Theatre, originally called the Department of Dramatic Art. James H. Causey made a generous initial donation that purchased a full set of state-of-the-art equipment for the aspiring theatre program back in the 1920s. The well known Denver artist John E. Thompson decorated the Little Theater with a mural of Shakespearean characters. Lost for decades, an ambitious reclamation and restoration project is slowly bringing life back to this outstanding work of art in Margery Reed Hall. The University Civic Theatre produced several highly-acclaimed plays during the early years, and Margery Reed Hall emerged as one of the centers of drama in the Rocky Mountain region. The building has served other functions as well since then, such as the backdrop for some outdoor commencements. Recently the Daniels College of Business has begun to use the building as the home of its Office of Undergraduate Programs.

The exterior of Margery Reed Hall has a set of stone shields with seven virtues of Christian theology inscribed upon them (Fortitude, Hope, Temperance, Prudence, Justice, Charity and Faith). The statue “Alma Mater” was originally dedicated along with the hall to honor the women Margery and Mary Reed and stood on the central south side of the building. Produced by the noted Denver sculptor Enrico Licari, it shows mother and daughter (or alma mater and student) studying together peacefully. This statue, now resides in the Harper Humanities Gardens</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __Originally constructed to replace Carnegie Library as the main campus library in 1933, the Mary Reed Building has evolved to serve many different uses. What is now called the Mary Reed Building was constructed as the Mary Reed Library as a stone inscription on the front (east side) of the structure still reads.  The Mary Reed Building is located at  2199 South University Blvd. Denver, CO 80208.

The Carnegie Library which it replaced was barely 20 years old but already incapable of meeting the University’s growing need for library resources. To find the money needed for the ambitious project the University turned to its most magnanimous benefactress, Mary Reed, who was known as “Denver’s Lady Bountiful.” Having already donated the impressive sum of $200,000 for the construction of the Margery Reed Hall in honor of her daughter, Mary Reed provided an additional $500,000 for the library project and a related endowment A portrait of Mary Reed hangs in the DuPont Room in Mary Reed to commemorate the generosity of one of the University’s most generous benefactresses.

Noted Denver architect Harry J. Manning led the Mary Reed Library design team. The University had decided that it wanted to maintain the same Collegiate Gothic aesthetic that had shaped Margery Reed Hall as they developed the new library. As a result the design team used similar building materials, including rose-colored bricks and Indiana limestone.

A major decision was the placement of the library. Although some wanted to maintain the open view to the west between University Hall and the Iliff School of Theology, the University ultimately chose to follow the Jeffersonian model from the University of Virginia: place the library at the highest and most prominent site on campus.  Another feature of the building was its floor plan: an “H” shape allowed natural light to fill the building during the day. The new building provided the University with all of the facilities needed for its central library: space for 400,000 volumes, “spacious reading rooms, customized furniture designed by the building’s architect, numerous exhibit rooms for archaeology and art displays, mullioned bay windows, wrought-iron railings with aluminum caps, exhibit cases, and a distinctive clustering of cathedral lights.” The building was dedicated over three days during the fall of 1932.

The Mary Reed Library would serve as the main campus library for 40 years. By the 1960s however it was already clear that the university needed an even larger library. Penrose Library was built in 1972 as the successor to Mary Reed. The University found that Mary reed was easily adaptable to other uses. Today the building houses many administrative offices such as the Chancellor’s and Provost’s offices and the Honors program. Efforts to modify the building have been kept to a minimum, and the marble floors, Renaissance-style woodwork and Gothic-style windows remain. Recently the University demonstrated its commitment to the future of the building by funding an extensive tuck-pointing project that will replace much of the mortar on the structure Though the exterior of the building looks much as it did in 1932, a great deal has changed around it thanks to campus beautification efforts.  The serene Harper Humanities Garden introduced a winding water feature connecting the Mary Reed Building to Evans Chapel.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The Robert and Judi Newman Center for the Performing Arts at the University of Denver is one of the finest venues for the performing arts anywhere in Colorado. It serves the needs of the University community by housing the Lamont School of Music and presenting the work of the DU Theatre Department. It also hosts numerous productions from traveling groups.  The Robert and Judi Newman Center for Performing Arts is located at 2344 East Iliff Avenue Denver, CO 80208.

The Newman Center represented a breakthrough in the history of the performing arts programs at the University. Completed in 2002, it provided the Lamont School of Music with the magnificent home that its faculty and students had long desired. Founded in 1924, the school had moved from one home to another for decades.  Thanks to the bold leadership of Chancellor Daniel Ritchie, the University finally achieved enough financial stability in the 1990s to look towards building a permanent home for the performing arts on the University Park campus. Private donations covered a substantial portion of the construction costs. DU Trustee Robert Newman and his wife Judi stepped forward with a very generous gift that solidified their reputation as proud patrons of the arts and staunch supporters of the University.

As with the Ritchie Center, Chancellor Dan Ritchie and University architect Cabell “Cab” Childress found the proper aesthetic inspiration for the building.  Once again they were drawn to European influences: Childress wanted a building reminiscent of “a smooth cup of Viennese coffee in the afternoon.” Childress also worked closely with the Joe Docksey, the Director of the Lamont School of Music, to ensure that the building served the students’ needs above all else. Lastly, Ritchie made sure that those involved in the project were aware of its importance for the City of Denver: he wanted this performing arts center to welcome people from outside of the University community as well. The Newman Center cost approximately $67 million to construct, making it the second most expensive construction project in DU history behind only the Ritchie Center.

The Newman Center actually consists of five distinct structures, each with its own foundation. This allows two inches of acoustic dead space to separate them. As a result each venue can host its own event without disturbing any other part of the Center. Virginia E. Trevorrow Hall is the five-story home of the Lamont School of Music. Containing technologically-advanced classrooms, state-of-the-art practice spaces, a digital recording studio and an extensive music library, Trevorrow Hall serves all of the academic needs of the music school. It also has the distinction of housing an “All-Steinway School,” meaning that all of its pianos are made by one of the finest piano manufacturer in the world. The centerpiece of the Newman Center is the June Swaner Gates Concert Hall, inspired by Italian opera houses.  It serves the Denver community’s need for a medium-sized contemporary theater with 1000 seats. Nonetheless, its stage is still large enough to showcase the most ambitious traveling theatrical productions. The design process incorporated Kirkegaard Associates, a group of world-class acousticians, to create one of the most acoustically-advanced facilities in the West. The same company also helped with the construction of the Frederic C. Hamilton Family Recital Hall. Housing a 2,500-pipe Schuke Orgelbau Berlin organ it provides the university with an ideal venue for student recitals. The neighboring Elizabeth Eriksen Byron Theater serves as the home of the DU Theatre Department’s productions. Its unique design offers  flexibility with 42 possible arrangements. The Theatre program takes full advantage of this asset employing creative approaches for staging shows. Joy Burns Plaza unites the spaces, housing the Newman Center’s box office. It serves as a gathering place for music students during the day and the lobby for the venues’ audiences during the evening. On the exterior, a massive sundial keeps the time of day on the south side. Figures representing classical and jazz music grace the north side of the building. A beautiful rose window carved into the stone glows on the west side of the building at night. 

According to its official mission statement, the “Newman Center for the Performing Arts strives to provide the highest quality performing arts experiences for faculty, students, performers and the Colorado community.”</Bio_Org_History>

Housing a 2,500-pipe Schuke Orgelbau Berlin organ it provides the university with an ideal venue for student recitals. The neighboring Elizabeth Eriksen Byron Theater serves as the home of the DU Theatre Department’s productions. Its unique design offers  flexibility with 42 possible arrangements. The Theatre program takes full advantage of this asset employing creative approaches for staging shows. Joy Burns Plaza unites the spaces, housing the Newman Center’s box office. It serves as a gathering place for music students during the day and the lobby for the venues’ audiences during the evening. On the exterior, a massive sundial keeps the time of day on the south side. Figures representing classical and jazz music grace the north side of the building. A beautiful rose window carved into the stone glows on the west side of the building at night. 

According to its official mission statement, the “Newman Center for the Performing Arts strives to provide the highest quality performing arts experiences for faculty, students, performers and the Colorado community.”</Bio_Org_History_Organiz._History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __F. W. Olin Hall is the newest science building at the University of Denver. Built to meet the expanding needs of Chemistry and Biology programs, Olin Hall exemplifies the University’s commitment to both architectural tradition and technological innovation in building design.  F.W. Olin Hall is located at 2190 East Iliff Avenue Denver, CO 80208.

Olin Hall represented a major turning point in the history of the University. After coming out of a tumultuous period in the school’s history, Olin Hall was the first construction project that demonstrated the institution’s renewed financial stability in the ensuing decade of the 1990’s. It was the first instructional space built in nearly 30 years. In the early 1990s, DU had begun its ambitious University of Denver Campaign, a capital campaign which aimed to raise enough funding for the construction of a new generation of buildings and for the rejuvenation of on-campus academic programs. One of the first signs of the project’s forthcoming success appeared when the University received a grant from the F. W. Olin Foundation.  The only organization dedicated to funding the construction of new buildings at independent colleges and universities, the foundation generously provided the University with over $7 million, enough to build, equip and furnish a state-of-the-art science facility. The administration realized the symbolic significance of the gift as well: the F. W. Olin Foundation only offers grants to institutions that demonstrate financial health and academic promise. DU badly needed the new space considering that undergraduate enrollment in the sciences in the early 1990s had increased very rapidly.

A new science building had been at the top of the administration’s priority list for several years by the time ground was broken in 1995. In 1997 DU finally achieved its goal of providing biology and chemistry students with a truly-modern building.

Olin Hall illustrates the University’s unique fusion of the old and new. The structure was designed in the Collegiate Gothic style, intentionally complementing Mary Reed Building and Margery Reed Hall in the use of brick, granite, limestone and copper.  However, the thought that went into the inside of the structure was equally impressive. The Hall houses the expected instructional laboratories, classrooms, lecture halls, offices and greenhouse, though their configurations are on the cutting edge of design. The space is configured to encourage both student-student interaction and student-faculty interaction. It also takes full advantage of the latest in computer connectivity, including interactive learning. With its forward-looking design, Olin Hall can continue to lead the University’s science programs for decades to come.

Since the completion of Olin Hall, the University entered into the most pronounced era of new construction in its history. All of those successors have been built to model Olin Hall’s successful synthesis of tradition and innovation.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The Ricks Center houses a school for gifted young children affiliated with the University of Denver School of Education.   The Ricks Center is located at 2040 South York Street Denver, CO 80208.

Norma Lu Hafenstein, one of the teachers behind the original summer project that evolved into Ricks, was a doctoral student in gifted education at DU. She believed that the ideal gifted education program addressed “the whole child, including his or her emotional, intellectual, aesthetic, physical and social needs”. That first summer program was a tremendous success, and parents expressed interest in seeing the group’s approach to gifted education integrated into a school’s curriculum. With the implementation of a matching-based admissions process and the help of the DU School of Education, the University Center for Gifted Young Children was official founded in the fall of 1984. 

After a prolonged period of renting space from Denver Public Schools and borrowing University classrooms, the school began a fund drive to construct its own building.  In 1991, the Ricks Center was dedicated, named after the school’s principal benefactress, 

Alta Merle Ricks. Just five years later, a new addition was completed that added 10 more classrooms to the Ricks Center. 

Today an early childhood wing houses children as young as three and a middle school wing houses students through eighth grade, both part of expansion efforts. The facility contains a science laboratory, a studio for recording music, an art studio, a technology center, a foreign language laboratory and a multipurpose room (for physical education and theatre classes). The curriculum is tailored to meet the needs of individual students. “The processes of critical thinking, problem finding, problem solving, and evaluating act as an overlay for the various content areas included in the unit topic.” The Ricks Center has established itself as one of the premier gifted education schools in the Rocky Mountain region. The school’s accreditation by the North Central Association Commission on Accreditation and School Improvement in 1997 represented a significant milestone. 

Although the Ricks Center is a relatively new addition to the DU campus, it has already demonstrated its value to the University and the larger Denver community. Considering the recent emergence of the Fisher Early Learning Center as a partner for the Ricks Center, the University has demonstrated a real commitment to fostering quality education from a very young age.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __Completed in 1999, the Daniel L. Ritchie Center for Sports and Wellness is the primary facility for athletic and recreational activity at the University of Denver.  The Daniel L. Ritchie Center for Sports and Wellness is located at 2201 East Asbury Avenue Denver, CO 80208.

According to Chancellor Emeritus Daniel Ritchie, the Center was “a dream come true that we weren’t sure would come true.” When he became Chancellor in the late 1980s Ritchie inherited a University with deep financial problems. His exceptional leadership qualities initiated a transformation for the University. Shortly after his arrival, the administration launched the University of Denver Campaign, the most comprehensive fundraising effort it had ever undertaken. One of the major slated projects was a state-of-the-art sports and wellness center. Ritchie noted that everything else about the University was already Division I so he believed that the athletics programs deserved the same. Named in honor of Chancellor Ritchie, the bold building was far and away the most extensive and expensive construction project in school history. In fact, the Ritchie Center promised to be twice as large as the old DU Arena and Field House. Thanks in large part to Ritchie’s energetic fundraising, approximately 90% of the $70 million cost was funded entirely by private donations. The list of those who contributed included some of the most prominent names in Colorado philanthropy. Ritchie convinced these benefactors that they were constructing a building that would truly stand the test of time.

He and lead architect Cabell “Cab” Childress took their aesthetic inspiration from the Mediterranean. Williams Tower, the crown jewel of the Ritchie Center, was actually modeled after a tower at the University of Bologna in Italy. Thanks to the use of quality building materials such as sandstone, limestone and copper, the Ritchie Center is built to last hundreds of years. The Center represented an important part of the university’s commitment to developing the whole person for Ritchie. It also promised to provide the Denver community with a valuable asset, a place where the University community could interact with the public. As the inscription from Thomas Jefferson on the west wall says, “A strong body makes the mind strong.”

The Williams Tower, easily seen from I-25, is perhaps the most widely-recognized University landmark today.  Magness Arena is the center point of the Ritchie Center, hosting Pioneer hockey games as well as other Division I sporting competitions, concerts and social events. Hamilton Gymnasium hosts DU basketball, volleyball and gymnastics programs. El Pomar Natatorium, which houses an Olympic-sized pool, serves the needs of the DU swimming and diving programs. The Coors Fitness Center, Joy Burns Arena and the Gates Field House all provide the University with valuable space for varsity practices, club sports events and recreational activities. Significantly, all of these venues also serve the public. Ritchie realized how valuable the Center would be to the surrounding community with its ability to host all kinds of athletic and social occasions.  To top it off, the Williams Tower houses a grand concert carillon imported from the Netherlands. With the construction of the Ritchie Center, the university proved that it had entered a new era of financial and athletic prosperity.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __Science Hall at the University of Denver was the first building dedicated to the study of the sciences at DU. Completed in 1912, the Science Hall  continued to serve the University through 1996.  

When ground was broken in 1911, only three university buildings stood at the University Park campus, University Hall, Chamberlin Observatory and the Carnegie Library. William McDowell, the University’s second Chancellor, returned for Science Hall’s groundbreaking to celebrate the marvelous growth of the young campus. Chancellor Henry Buchtel had initiated the fundraising effort for the building, and Andrew Carnegie had once again stepped forward for Denver in a most generous way. After the steel magnate had donated $30,000 to build the school’s library, Carnegie kindly offered $50,000 for the construction of the science building. He also gave an additional $5,000 to provide it with the latest in scientific equipment. The total cost was nearly $100,000, with the additional monies coming entirely from Robert Beggs, William Hartman, Charles Crews, William Evans, Charles Hughes and William Pardee.

Now the University had a three-story building with sufficient space to meet the needs of the rapidly-developing science departments. Despite these significant donations, the project did not have a sufficient budget, and the building did not have the same elegant architecture and practical interior design that characterized the other early University buildings. Those who worked in it over the years were not particularly fond of it. Although Chemistry and Physics were the primary early tenants, Science Hall would eventually house Biology as well.

Although the Science Hall clearly needed to be replaced towards the end of its career, its meaning to the early University community should not be forgotten. The old cornerstone from the Science Hall is on display in Olin Hall today. The construction of the Science Hall demonstrated the university’s commitment to scientific inquiry and foreshadowed the eventual emergence of some of the finest science programs in the Rocky Mountain region.

Science Hall served the university well for 85 years, but towards the end of its life it was clear that DU needed a replacement. A great deal had changed in the sciences over that time span. Despite the addition of the Boettcher Center, the Seeley G. Mudd Building and the Space Sciences Research Center (now called the Physics Building), the University lacked the space that it needed for Chemistry and Biology classes. By the 1970s, Glenn Davis, Director of the Physical Plant at the University, received constant requests for renovation work in the Science Hall. The building was inadequate for the needs of modern science departments. The University administration did not have the funds at the time to provide the sciences with a new classroom and laboratory building. Finally, with the success of the University of Denver Campaign, Chancellor Daniel Ritchie found the needed financial support to replace Science Hall. Despite its historical significance, there was no opposition to demolishing the structure: the University needed to move its science programs forward. In the 1990s, enrollment in chemistry and biology programs at the University had risen drastically. With the construction of F.W. Olin Hall in 1997, those departments finally had the state-of-the-art home that they deserved.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __The Seeley G. Mudd Building is one of three principal buildings for the Departments of Chemistry and Biological Sciences on the University of Denver campus. Its construction in 1982 represented a major step forward for the sciences at DU, which sorely needed a new building.  The Seeley G. Mudd Building is located at 2101 East Wesley Avenue Denver, CO 80208.

When the University first broke ground for its new science building, chemistry and biology classes on campus were housed at ten different locations. The University needed a new facility that could handle the programs’ expanding needs. Fortunately the Denver Design capital campaign (a $50 million endeavor) included a new science building as a priority. Two individual foundations were especially generous in their funding for the project: the Boettcher Foundation of Denver and the Seeley G. Mudd Fund of Los Angeles, offering $4 million and $1.5 million respectively. Seeley G. Mudd was a Denver native as well as a renowned scientist and philanthropist. The building would serve as the newest element of a science complex, which included Boettcher Center for Science and Research and the Space Sciences Research Center (now known as the Physics Building). In March of 1982, the University dedicated the Seeley G. Mudd Building, a $6.9 million, 64,000 square-foot investment in the future of its science programs. It was one of the most expensive construction projects in the University’s history up to that point. Linus Pauling, one of a handful of people to have won two Nobel Prizes (Chemistry in 1954 and Peace in 1962), delivered an inspirational address to the excited crowd during the opening ceremonies. 

The Seeley G. Mudd Building remains an important facility for DU science programs today. Just as it set a precedent for academic cooperation between chemical and biological inquiry upon its completion, the structure continues to provide them both with classrooms and research laboratories. Although the newer Olin Hall might overshadow its older neighbor in terms of lasting aesthetic value, there is no question about the practical importance of the latter to the development of stronger chemistry and biology programs at DU over the past 25 years.

The DU administration believed that the Seeley G. Mudd Science Building would provide two of its most popular departments with the home that they so dearly needed. Now, with the help of Olin Hall, that same building continues to meet that need in the 21st century.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __Dedicated in 1979, the Shwayder Art Building is home to the School of Art and Art History (SAAH) at the University of Denver.  The Shwayder Art Building is located at 2121 East Asbury Avenue CO, 80208.

The history of arts programs at the university dates back to 1880, when a drawing class was offered. By the 1970’s those programs had expanded enough to need a permanent home of their own. By the time construction began on the Shwayder Art Building in 1977 the School of Art had emerged as one of the most popular schools on campus. However, the program’s facilities were woefully inadequate. Mel Strawn, Director of the School of Art, argued that the state of the buildings was impeding further development of the program. Art classes were spread throughout the campus in eight separate buildings. Several of those structures were prefabricated military huts. Although originally purchased to accommodate a massive influx of students after World War II, in 1977 those “temporary” buildings were still being used for art classes despite the fact that some of them were quite literally falling apart. The University administration had had a modern art facility placed at the top of its new construction list for some time, but only upon the donation of a generous grant in the amount of $1.7 million from the Jesse and Nellie Shwayder Foundation could DU finally begin to make those plans a reality. Jesse Shwayder had founded the Shwayder Trunk Manufacturing Company in Denver soon after the turn of the century, and his small company eventually grew to became the  Samonsite Luggage Corporation. Total cost of the project would eventually reach 2.8 million dollars. 

The Shwayder Art Building continues to house the School of Art and Art History today. The three-story structure was designed with a high degree of versatility to meet the many needs of the school. It houses all of the school’s art related classes (drawing, ceramics, print-making, sculpture, painting, photography and art history) within a single home. The Victoria H. Myhren Gallery displays noteworthy exhibits, both University and non-University related, that attract a wide audience from throughout the Denver area.</Bio_Org_History>

      <Bio_Org_History>__ __Hilltop Stadium (DU Stadium) stood as one of the most impressive stadiums in the Rocky Mountain area from its dedication in 1926 to its demolition in 1971. It served as the home of the University of Denver football team from 1925 through 1961, when DU dropped football. It also hosted track and field events, other colleges’ football games and even professional football games.

By 1924 DU football needed a new home: the team had been playing at University Park since 1909 with a grandstand that could seat only 10,000.  DU alumni decided to launch an ambitious public bond drive. DU broke ground for Hilltop Stadium in March of 1925.

The construction costs ran just under $751,000, with the project using one million board-feet of lumber, 7,000 cubic feet of concrete and 295 tons of steel. The community rallied around the new structure which earned the nickname “Monument to Concrete.”  As a crowning touch, the famous sculptor Robert Garrison created two massive figures of athletes, one male and one female, to grace the Stadium’s main entrance as symbols of the value of coeducation and “the vitality, the vigor, and the strength of modern American youth”.

Hilltop Stadium witnessed a wide range of events during its history. Many of DU football’s most glorious victories came on its field. In the venue’s first official game, DU defeated Colorado School of Mines by a score of 27-7. However, no regional match-up overshadowed the annual rivalry game between DU and the University of Colorado (CU) at Thanksgiving. This tradition came to end when CU joined a different athletic conference in 1948. The Denver Broncos also played at Hilltop Stadium from time to time. The facility also hosted other sports during its history including soccer and track and field. The use of Hilltop Stadium extended beyond the realm of athletic competition as well. For example, Charles Lindbergh visited the Denver landmark during a parade held in his honor. Hilltop Stadium also hosted outdoor theater productions and DU commencement ceremonies for a number of years.

DU decided to demolish Hilltop Stadium in 1971. Although the large saddle-shaped section on the west side was removed, the far smaller section to the east remained for a while longer. The venue had started to crumble, and after the discontinuation of the DU football program in 1961, a costly reconstruction of the main grandstand seemed unwarranted. DU also needed the space for its growing intramural sports program: new plans included ten lighted tennis courts and three regulation-sized playing fields for a wide variety of sports. DU has maintained a tradition of changing the configuration of this space to fit the recreational needs of its students. Today, the Benjamin F.

It served as the home of the University of Denver football team from 1925 through 1961, when DU dropped football. It also hosted track and field events, other colleges’ football games and even professional football games.

By 1924 DU football needed a new home: the team had been playing at University Park since 1909 with a grandstand that could seat only 10,000.  DU alumni decided to launch an ambitious public bond drive. DU broke ground for Hilltop Stadium in March of 1925.

The construction costs ran just under $751,000, with the project using one million board-feet of lumber, 7,000 cubic feet of concrete and 295 tons of steel. The community rallied around the new structure which earned the nickname “Monument to Concrete.”  As a crowning touch, the famous sculptor Robert Garrison created two massive figures of athletes, one male and one female, to grace the Stadium’s main entrance as symbols of the value of coeducation and “the vitality, the vigor, and the strength of modern American youth”.

Hilltop Stadium witnessed a wide range of events during its history. Many of DU football’s most glorious victories came on its field. In the venue’s first official game, DU defeated Colorado School of Mines by a score of 27-7. However, no regional match-up overshadowed the annual rivalry game between DU and the University of Colorado (CU) at Thanksgiving. This tradition came to end when CU joined a different athletic conference in 1948. The Denver Broncos also played at Hilltop Stadium from time to time. The facility also hosted other sports during its history including soccer and track and field. The use of Hilltop Stadium extended beyond the realm of athletic competition as well. For example, Charles Lindbergh visited the Denver landmark during a parade held in his honor. Hilltop Stadium also hosted outdoor theater productions and DU commencement ceremonies for a number of years.

DU decided to demolish Hilltop Stadium in 1971. Although the large saddle-shaped section on the west side was removed, the far smaller section to the east remained for a while longer. The venue had started to crumble, and after the discontinuation of the DU football program in 1961, a costly reconstruction of the main grandstand seemed unwarranted. DU also needed the space for its growing intramural sports program: new plans included ten lighted tennis courts and three regulation-sized playing fields for a wide variety of sports. DU has maintained a tradition of changing the configuration of this space to fit the recreational needs of its students. Today, the Benjamin F. Stapleton, Jr. Tennis Pavilion and the varsity soccer field stand on the site of the old Hilltop Stadium.</Bio_Org_History_Organiz._History>
