# Re:Discovery Files

These are the raw XML files we extracted from Re:Discovery for use in migrating to ArchivesSpace in the summer of 2014. They represent data from the following sections of the application:

* Accessions
* Collections
* Series
* File Units (boxes and folders)
* Items
* Personal names
* Corporate names
* Family names
* Subject headings of all types

They are presented here for historical purposes and to refer back to original records when comparing to the current ArchivesSpace iterations of the resources described.
